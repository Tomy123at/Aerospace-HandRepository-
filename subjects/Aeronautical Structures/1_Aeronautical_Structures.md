# Aeronautical Structures

This directory is dedicated to Aeronautical Structures, providing a thorough collection of materials for understanding the analysis and design of aircraft and spacecraft structures. The content needs to be completed, the course itself isn't to rigurous. 

**A320 - SRM** and Jane's book is included in alternative folder. (Is'nt in this repository)

**V-N Exce**l is really useful to design topics.
