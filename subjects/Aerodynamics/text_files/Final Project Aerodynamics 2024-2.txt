 Summary (justification)  
 
The UPB Aeronautical Engineering Faculty acting under its learning context 
adopts the CDIO methodology used by the engineering school from  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT), which tries to show the students 
through  experimental  exercises ( real-life projects) the way of developing 
practical learning methodologies with the use of the following procedure:  
 
• Conceive  – The student conceives an idea to solve a problem by discussing  
pre-established requirements, focusing on precise objectives  they want  and 
should accomplish. For example, they define customer needs, consider 
technology, enterprise strategy, and regulations, and develop  concepts, 
techniques,  and business plans . 
• Develop  – The student should develop the previously  conceived idea using the 
classical brainstorming method , in which they make  a classification of the 
information and an analytical result analysis. Then, c reating the design , the 
plans, drawings, and algorithms that describe what could  be implemented . 
• Implement  – The student implements the developed idea by using tests to 
identify  possible failures in regular  operation, opening the option to correct 
the original design. The design transformation into the product includes  
manufacturing, coding, testing , and validation . 
• Operate  – The student operates their design once the previous steps have 
been overcome . They use  the implemented product to deliver the intended 
value, including maintaining, evolving,  and retiring the system.  
 
For this activity , it would be  expected that the students develop a possible 
solution to a problem using the resources of the knowledge extracted from the 
theory , applying as many tools as they can.  
 
Each team is responsible for knowing and following  all provided rules, the FAQ, 
and all contest day briefings.  
 
Questions can be addressed  to the contest director as outlined in the 
communications section  at the end of this document.  
   1. Judging:  
Students must design, document, fabricate, and demonstrate that the designed 
aircraft is a feasible solution for the problem  and can achieve  the challenge of 
obtaining  the highest score on the specified flight mission. Flight scores are 
established  based on some physical characteristics of the model and on  
demonstra tive mission performance obtained during the challenge contest.  
 
Each team must submit a written final “Design Report ”. A maximum grade of 
5.0 can be an award  for the team ’s “Design R eport ” and “Flight test” , depending 
on the ir own prototype's content quality and flight qualities . Scores for the 
written reports are known  during  the technical inspection.  
 
The overall team grade combines  the final Design Report and Flight 
performance.  
 
All submitted final Design Reports would  pass a process of plagiarism check 
throughout Turnitin ® (moodle) . In addition, t he final design reports must 
comply with the AIAA paper template.  
 
2. Objective  
Conceive, design, construct , and operate an aerodynamic glider airplane model 
capable of carrying an external payload , applying the knowledge acquired during  
the aerodynamics  course  lectures  and laboratory  sessions  to glide two high -range  
missions through the air with and without the required payload.  
 
3. Requirements and constraints  
All the requirements are compulsory; failure  to accomplish  any of them implies 
the probability of passing the technical inspection (first test) , and therefore, a 
successful flight is reduced or nullified . 
 
3.1  Requirements  
a. The aircraft must be a glider  vehicle (fixed wing ) with no propulsion system 
of any kind allowed.  The external payload weight  and the flight model 
vehicle will be launched together from the highest possible location of the 
UPB sports center  (indoors).  
b. For both missions, the airplane can be initially thrust -assisted using a 
catapult to commence the flight (IMPORTANT NOTE: the students’ team 
that chose this type of initial thrust must provide the  catapult ). 
c. During the technical inspection and the flight test, no structure/components 
or external payload can fall from the airplane. Therefore, all decisions made  
by the safety inspector (s) during the technical inspection and the fly day  are 
final . 
d. The payload consists of three types of water bottles (different in shape and 
weight) full of liquid . Each  bottle is labeled  with a number  (1, 2, and 3). The  label number indicates the score that will be added  as a grade  bonus for the 
second mission in the following way:  
 
• Bottle No. 1 → 1.0 
• Bottle No. 2 → 0.6 
• Bottle No. 3 → 0.3 
 
You can find m ore information about the  grade bonus in section 8 of this 
document. The glider must be able  to carry  only one of  the bottles externally  
exposed  at the bottom part of the fuselage (airplane´s belly) . These bottles 
will be available at building 11, 3rd level floor (office 317 – secretary´s 
premises ). As a clarification, the airplane must carry only one o f the three 
bottles during flight; each group decides to select which  payloads they will 
use for the flight . You cannot  modify the bottle´s shape ; nevertheless,  it is 
allowed to  add elements to decrease the payload´s drag . Each group of 
students is responsible for characterizing  and parametriz ing each  payload  
(materials, weight,  and measures) . 
e. The payload  and the glider model vehicle will be launched from the highest 
part of the south UPB sports center  (indoors).  
f. For the first and second mission s, the model (including the payload weight) 
should glide through the air , allowing it to land  safely  inside the established 
areas. 
g. The solution model must  be a glider fixed -wing aircraft  (teams are free to 
choose a ny configu ration ). 
 
3.2  Constraints  
a. The aerial vehicle must use aerodynamic forces  to maintain a steady glide 
flight.  
b. A propulsion  system  of any kind is not allowed . 
c. c. The vehicle must be strong enough to withstand many  flights without 
significantly damaging  the integrity of the airplane.  
d. If the model suffers a ny damage during the activity, the group can make 
(if possible) the respective repairs  during the activity.  
e. When the airplane is in flight , the device (model) should maintain itself 
as a unit ; if any part falls  from the vehicle , the flight is considered invalid.  
f. You can have more than one model with the restriction that the other 
vehicle (s) must have the same design and  have to pass the technical 
inspection. I f a group uses two or more different  glider models  (different 
designs) , the group will be disqualified from the activity , obtaining  a grade 
of zero in the total final project.  
g. In case of any modification of the airplane model from the moment  it 
passes the technical inspection until the flight activity, the group will be 
disqu alified with a grade of 0,0 in the functionality (flight) percentage .  h. If the airplane model does not comply with the minimum distance (Z1) 
and structural integrity requirements  during the flights, the group will be 
graded 0,0 in the functionality (flight) percentage.  
i. The use of control systems  (e.g. transmitters, receivers, Arduino, 
Ardupilot, Arducopter, Raspberry -pi, etc.) is forbidden . 
 
4. General rules  
 
4.1  Group rules  
The groups can have a maximum of three  students . Each group must 
represent a specific theme, which identifies  them (team and vehicle name). 
This team  theme must  be presented in t he report and during the flight's due 
date. 
 
4.2  Written report (design report)  
A written report must be delivered in a scientific way (paper) using the AIAA 
template for LaTeX called " LaTeX Template for the Preparation of Papers for 
AIAA Technical Conferences" found in Overleaf using the following link:

5. Milestone s 
Each group will have a 40 -minute window for the milestone presentations  to 
show the project work done so far in the semester. You will have to present 
the following basic requirements:  
• General design and aircraft description , including CAD drawings with 
three views and dimensions.  
• Description of the technical approaches to meet the proposed 
requirements.  
• Calculation of the aerodynamic forces.  
• Balance and weight.   • Wing design and Airfoil  selection process.  
• Payload characterization.  
• The s tructural design process , including the payload arrangement.  
• Launching system (in case of having one).  
• Selected materials and manufacturing initial budget estimations.  
• Originality and unique features.  
 
All the last items should be covered  during t he presentation s that must  have  
at least  the following : 
 
Score equation analysis : Define the main  factors your group aims  for in the 
airplane's design , establishing  through sensitivity studies the “design 
drivers”  accomplishing the requirements and constraints . 
Payload characterization : Define the general  measures of the payload, 
including the weight study and the location of the c.g. 
Flight characteristics : Determine the operational velocity, heights,  and the 
aircraft´s  initial weight estimation. Study the operating environment , 
identifying the main measures from  the sports center  facility , defining 
heights, lengths, possible obstacles,  and operational times.  
Airfoil selection (methodology) : This section explains the airfoil selection 
process and defines  the main aerodynamic characteristics of a group of 
airfoils.  
Wing selection (methodology) : From a total operational weight estimation, 
determine the wing design at least for the most critical flight mission. 
Establish  the flight conditions at every flight mission.  
Empennage design : Define the empennage design based on statistical 
methods.  
Fuselage design : The fuselage should  withstand the  loads  imparted by the 
aerodynamic sources and payload. You must show the approxim ation of this 
component through  CAD blueprints in which the principal dimensions are 
identified . 
Aerodynamic forces calculation : Define the main aerodynamic forces to which 
the airplane will be loaded employing  mathematical models.  
Weight and balance : Establish  an approximation of the maximum weight 
reached by the preliminary design , which is  determined by the materials you 
think to use to build the prototype . Determine the first approach to  the c.g. 
location from these data and justify the results.  Then,  given the general 
airplane design and the materials used, you should calculate an approximate 
structural proposal to counteract the loads the aircraft will be subject to 
during operation.  
Launching system : Indicate the process used to launch the airplane for the 
flight missions. If the airplane uses an initial impulse  system other than 
hand -launched (e.g. , a catapult system), indicate its operational 
characteristics.   Costs estimate : Calculate the total project cost by considering the materials 
selected for  the airplane design . 
 
See section 8.1 of this document for more information about the milestones.  
 
6. Tech Inspection (TI) 
• The a ircraft will enter the TI fully assembled and ready  to fly (RTF) . 
• The a ircraft will undergo the wing tip lift test with installed maximum flight 
payload weight . 
• The aircraft will be held and shaken upside down to ensure its structural 
strength . 
• The TI will check that the prototype is the same as the one reported 
(measures and weights must coincide).  
• The aircraft must have an indication (mark) of its c.g. in the empty and fully 
loaded configuration.  
 
7. Flight activity  
As mentioned , this activity will be performed  inside the UPB sports  center  
facility  (see Figure  1). Each team must check this premise before  the challenge 
flying contest to familiarize themselves  with the flight environment (including 
possible obstacles) and dimension  the field length and zones where  the vehicle 
should fly and land safely . 
 
7.1 About the activity (mission 1 and mission 2 explanation)  
This activity will  undergo  as many  flight trials  (for each  mission ) as possible . 
Teams that accomplish the first mission will obtain the pass to perform the 
second mission. The group  or team with the highest score will win the 
highest grade for this activity . In the following sections, you will find a 
detailed explanation of the grades  obtained in the flight tests . 
 
7.1.1  Activity general rules  
The Flight Missions must be flown in order, meaning the second mission cannot 
be flown until the team successfully scores for the first mission. The result is 
considered independently, meaning that the closest to the predicted distance 
(for both missions) by the report are the ones taken for the final grade.  
 
The flight tests are not done all in one, which means that during t he activity, 
you would have time to perform any repair or minor change (if needed ) to your 
model for the next flight test opportunity. In addition, the flight window given 
to accomplish missions 1 and 2 will be between 1 pm and 5 pm, meaning that 
you could  do as many flights as possible for each mission, but with the 
restriction that you can only perform mission 2 when mission 1 has a valid score  
(the airplane lands in Z1) . 
   
Figure 1. UPB Sport’s center  – Top view  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Demarked landing zones inside the facility  
 
 Missions 1 and 2 will account for flight distance and precision accuracy this 
semester . The airplane must be launched from the highest part of the upper 
south side of the UPB’s sports center (see Figure 2 for reference). In addition, 
there are s even  specific zones in which the aircraft can land. Airplane flight is 
scored depending on the zone in which it lands:  
 
• Zone 0 (Z0) is red color in Figure 2 . 
• Zone 1 (Z1) is white color in Figure 2 . 
• Zone 2 (Z2) is orange color in Figure 2 . 
• Zone 3  (Z3) is yellow color in Figure 2 . 
• Zone 4 (Z4) is blue color in Figure 2 . 
• Zone 5 (Z5) is purple color in Figure 2 . 
• Bonus Zone s (BZ) are established as the two goalkeepers' arc (goal area) 
separated in such a way that leaves a space  between the two arcs ; and is 
green color in Figure 2  
 
The score will be multiplied by the number depending on which zone the airplane 
lands in; this  means that if your airplane lands in Zone 0  (Z0), your flight factor  
ZX is zero; if it lands in Zone 1 (Z1), your flight factor ZX will be 1, etc.  The BZ 
will have a factor of 6. The zones can be seen  in Figure  2. 
 
7.1.2  Mission 1: Aircraft mission staging  
• There is no payload ( bottl es) for this flight . 
• Teams must complete this mission  within the flight window  to be able to 
perform mission 2 . 
• The m ission starts when the aircraft leaves the launcher ’s hand or the 
launching catapult . 
• Mission finishes when any part of the aircraft touches anything  during 
the glide  flight path . 
• To earn a score, the airplane must complete a successful landing , meaning 
it must be safe and sound at the end of the flight . 
• The score for this mission is evaluated as shown in equation 1.  
 
𝑀1=𝑍𝑋−|𝑥𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 −𝑥𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
𝑥𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡|    Eq. 1  
 
Where:  
✓ xflight – airplane’s distance traveled  during the first flight mission 
(beginning when  the aircraft starts its  flight until it touches any 
surface that stops the flight) – f (Wempty). 
✓ xreport – theoretical distance established  in the written design 
report  – f (Wempty). 
✓ ZX – constant factor  depending on the landing zone . 
  7.1.3  Mission 2: Short flight Max payload  
• You can only perform mission 2 when you get a valid flight (score) from 
mission 1  (M1 > 1.0). 
• For this flight, the payload (bottle) must be attached externally and 
exposed at the bottom of the airplane’s fuselage . 
• There will be a maximum 10-minute  flight window (depending on the 
number of teams) for each launch for this mission . 
• The m ission starts when the aircraft leaves the launcher ’s hand or the 
launching catapult . 
• Mission finishes when any part of the aircraft touches anything during 
the glide flight path . 
• To earn a score, the airplane must complete a successful landing , meaning 
it must be safe and sound at the end of the flight . 
• The score for this mission will be evaluated as shown in equation 2.  
 
𝑀2=(𝑍𝑋+𝑊𝑃𝑋 )−|𝑥𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 −𝑥𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
𝑥𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡|   Eq. 2  
 
Where:  
✓ xflight – airplane’s distance traveled  during the first flight mission 
(from the moment the aircraft begins flight until it touches any 
surface that stops the flight) – f (Wpayload). 
✓ xreport – theoretical distance established  in the written design 
report – f (Wpayload ). 
✓ ZX – constant factor depending on the landing zone . 
✓ WPX – is the score given depending on the payload size. The score 
is established  in the following manner:  
 
WPX  Score  
X = 1 1.0 
X = 2 0.6 
X = 3 0.3 
 
Note: i f the group gets a higher score than 5.0, the extra grade bonus will be 
added to the lowest grade you have so far in the laboratory . 
 
7.2  Activity scoring  
The score is divided into two main component s: the flight and written report 
scores . The sub -sequence sections fully explain  each component . 
 
7.2.1  Written Report Score (WRS)  
The written report has a value of 40% of the total score:  
• Abstract (2%)  
• Planning (2%)   • Procedure (10%)  
• Tests (6%)  
• Results analysis (8%)  
• Technical conclusions (8%) 
• References (2%)  
• Format (2%)  
 
7.2.2  Flight score  (FS) 
The flight score  will have a value of 60% of the total score ; the general score of 
the flight is determined using the following equation:  
 
𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡  𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =𝐹𝑆60% =(𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 ×𝐹𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 )50% +𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑠10% 
 
Functionality  & Flying quality  (50%) – Functionality  will be  dependent on the 
accuracy between the aerodynamics method(s) (mathematical model) and the 
flights during the presentation day . The accuracy of the theory and practice and 
the empty weight will be scored for the Functionality as shown in equation 3 . 
The Flying  quality  factor ( 0 or 1.0) will depend on the professional judgment 
perspective determined by the judges concerning  the aircraft's overall gliding 
performance and flight capabilities . 
 
𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 =1
2(𝑀1𝑊𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦+𝑀2𝑊𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑)+[(𝑊𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦 _𝑟𝑒𝑓
𝑊𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦)−1] Eq. 3  
 
Where:  
• M 1Wempty – mission 1 flight score . 
• M 2Wpayload – mission 2 flight score . 
• Wempty – airplane empty weight (Aircraft total weight without the payload 
bottles ). 
• Wempty _ref – minimum airplane empty weight registered by any team groups 
(reference empty weight) . 
• Wpayload  – airplane payload weight ( bottl es). 
 
Aesthetics  (10%) – The groups must have a representative theme that identifies 
them . For this item, the design and manufacturing will also be considered.  
 
7.2.3  Total score  
Equation 4 expresses the 100% activity scoring (grade), including the written 
report score (WRS), as follows:  
 
()()%60 %40 FS WRS Grade + =
   Eq. 4
