Drag divergence occurs when
the drag onanairfoil increases
faster asthe Mach number
increases .
MDDofanaircraft isusually
defined asthe point on the
CD−M∞curve ofaconstant CL
atwhich theslope becomes 0.1.

The X -1-1 (serial number 46 -062) had a wing with an 8% ( t/c)max
The X -1-2 (serial number 46 -063) had a 10% (t/c)max
Bell X -1 Case study
DESIGNING FOR TRANSONIC RANGE
Bell X -1 –Lessons learned (Design and tests)
Bell was battling thepitch control problem dueto"blanking"
the elevators (conventional horizontal tail).Avariable -
incidence tail (horizontal tailtoall-moving or"all-flying ")
appeared tobethemost promising solution, which theBritish
have already decided toapply intheMiles M.52.
