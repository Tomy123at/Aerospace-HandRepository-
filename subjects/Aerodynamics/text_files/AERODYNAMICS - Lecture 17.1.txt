SHOCK WAVES
Shock  waves  are formed  when  
the aircraft  (or parts  of it) are 
at a speed  range  of  M∞ ≥ 1.0.
Sound  waves  are slower  than 
aircraft  speed .
Air “piles  up” in compression  
waves,  which  creates  large  
changes  in the pressure,  
velocity,  and density  of the 
airflow .
SHOCK WAVES
3 types  of shock  waves :
1.Normal  - This type of shock  wave  forms  in front  (ahead)  or on a blunt  object  with a large  included  angle .
Blunt -nosed  objectOblique  shockSubsonic  region
Normal  
shockIn front  of the shock  
wave  – molecules  of 
gas pile up.
In front  of the object  – 
the pile-up molecules  
create  a detached  wave  
(bow  wave) .

followed  by boundary  layer  separation  that 
adversely  affects  lift, drag,  and other  flight  
parameters .

waveOn surface :
•Attached  to the curved  portion(s)  where  the 
airflow  speed  is just above  Mach  1.0.
•In transonic  range  – formed  on the upper  
airfoil  surface  first (at about  Mach  0.8), then 
on the lower  surface  (at about  0.85 Mach) .
Note : The indicated  Mach  numbers  vary  
depending  on the airfoil .Flow

followed  by boundary  layer  separation  that 
adversely  affects  lift, drag,  and other  flight  
parameters .On the surface  (at the wave) :
•Flow  direction  doesn’t  change .
•Velocity  decreases  (M < 1.0 – subsonic  
flow) .
•Subsonic  speed  inversely  proportional  
to Mach  number  entering  the wave  
(higher  a∞ going  into the wave  / lower  
subsonic  speed  coming  out of the 
wave) .
•Large  pressure,  density,  and 
temperature .
•Large  total energy  decrease  (from  
temperature  radiation  into the air).
•The pressure  waves  pile up at the 
dividing  line between  supersonic  and 
subsonic  flow,  creating  the normal  
shock  wave .

3 types  of shock  waves :
2.Oblique  - This type of shock  wave  forms  on sharp  edges  with surface  changing  into the direction  of the 
airflow  (commonly  on the leading  and the trailing  edges  of the airfoil) .

•Shock  waveforms  at an oblique  
angle  with the surface  and points  
downstream  in airflow .
•Angle  gets less as speed  goes up 
(flattens  out).
•At the wave :
•Flow  direction  is deflected  along  
the surface .
•Velocity  decreases  but stays  above  
Mach  1.0.
•p, T, and  increases .
•Total  energy  goes down  – energy  
loss comes  from  the loss of 
temperature  (heat  of compression)  
to the atmosphere .
SHOCK WAVES
3 types  of shock  waves :
3.Expansion  – this shock  wave  forms  where  the surface  turns  away  from  the airflow  direction  (i.e., middle  of 
an airfoil  – c/2).
•Velocity  increases .
•p and  both decrease .
•T remains  relatively  constant  – little 
or no total energy  change  (is not a 
compression  wave) .
