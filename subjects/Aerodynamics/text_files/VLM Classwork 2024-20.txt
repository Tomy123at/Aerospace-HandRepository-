Directions:  This classwork  can be completed with  any other individual's help . This includes help 
from other students (whether or not they are taking Aerodynamics), other faculty staff, people on the 
Internet, etc. You can use your books, class notes, library resources, etc. You must provide the 
numerica l or text answer as asked in each problem or question. The procedure and answer will be 
graded  following  the grade breakdown table below . Answers in the English language are 
compulsory for this classwork . Answers with wrong or no units will be penalized. T he percent ual 
error of the numerical answers is 5.0%. Absolutely no late classwork  will be accepted.  
 
This classwork must be done in group s of a maximum of three students .

1. For a wing with an aspect ratio of 4.2, wing area of 0.2 [m2], and taper ratio of 0.45, use of 
VLM (use four control points per semi -span) mathematical solution to obtain the values of 
the lift coefficient for the following leading -edge sweep angles and plot the results in a graph 
comparing both parameters:  
 
LE [deg]  CL,w 
3.5  
7.0  
10.0  
35.0  
 
 
2. Using  the VLM mathematical solution  (4 control points per semi -span) , calculate the lift 
coefficient for the swept wing  of the example explained during the lectures . The only 
difference s are that the wing has an aspect ratio of 8 , and the wing area is 0.125 [m2]. How 
does the lift coefficient for this aspect ratio (8) compare with that for an aspect ratio of 5? 
Conclude about the change in the lift coefficient when the aspect ratio varies.  
 
3. Using  the VLM mathematical solution (4 control points per semi -span) , calculate the lift 
coefficient for the swept wing  of the example explained during the lectures, a taper ratio of 
0.5 and a wing area of 0.2 [m2], an uncambered section, and the quarter chord swept 45°. 
Since the taper ratio is not unity, the leading edge, the quarter -chord line, the three -quarter -
chord line, and the trailing edge have different sweep angles. This should be considered when 
defining the coordinates of the horseshoe vortices and the control points.  
 
4. Using the VLM mathematical solution (4 contr ol points per semi -span), calculate the lift 
coefficient for a forward swept wing  in which a quarter chord is swept forward 45°, the aspect 
ratio is 3.55, the wing area is 0.2817 [m2], and the taper ratio is 0.5. The airfoil section 
(perpendicular to the q uarter chord) is a NACA 64A112. For this airfoil section L=0 = -0.94 
and cl, = 6.09 [1/rad] . Assume that the wing is planar to apply the no -flow boundary 
condition at the control points . Develop  a graph of the lift coefficient  versus the angle of 
attack .
