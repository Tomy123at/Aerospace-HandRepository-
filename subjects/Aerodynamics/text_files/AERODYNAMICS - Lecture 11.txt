•Value of aidepends on distribution 
of downwash along span of wing
•Downwash is governed by 
distribution of lift over span of wing
HOW TO ESTIMATE 
INDUCED DRAGSpecial Case: Elliptical Lift 
Distribution (produced by 
elliptical wing)
•Lift/unit span varies

Key Results:
Elliptical Lift Distribution
For all wings in general:
•Define a span efficiency factor, e(also called span efficiency factor)
•Elliptical planforms, e = 1.0
•The word planform means shape as view by looking down on the wing
•For all other planforms, e < 1(0.85 < e < 0.99)

EXAMPLE: NASA HELIOS
•Helios: Proof -of-concept solar -electric flying wing, designed to operate at extremely high altitudes for long 
duration, remotely piloted aircraft, AR = 30.9
•Helios Prototype designed to fly at altitudes of upto 100000 feet on single -day atmospheric science and imaging 
missions, as well as perform multi -day telecommunications relay missions at altitudes from 50000 to65000 ft.
•Helios Prototype set world altitude record for winged aircraft, 96863 ft, during a flight in August 2001 
•Flight at 100000 ft.is quite similar to that expected in the Martian atmosphere, so data obtained from the record 
altitude flight will also help to build NASA's technical and operational data base for future Mars aircraft designs 
and missions 
NOMINAL FLIGHT

•Airspeed: 19to 27mph cruise at low altitudes, up to 170mph at extreme altitude
•Altitude: Up to 100000 ft., typical endurance mission at 50000 to 70000 ft. 
•Aspect Ratio: 30.9This view ofthe Helios Prototype from achase helicopter shows anabnormally high wing
dihedral ofmore than 30ftfrom the wingtip tothe center ofthe aircraft that resulted after
theHelios entered moderate airturbulence onitslast test flight .The extreme dihedral caused
aerodynamic instability that ledtoanuncontrollable series ofpitch oscillations and over -speed
