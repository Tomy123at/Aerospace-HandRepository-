AERODYNAMICS
Aeronautical Engineering
School of Engineering
UPB• Aerodynamic forces exerted by airflow comes from only 2 sources:
1. Pressure, p, distribution on the surface.
• Acts normal to surface.
2. Shear stress, w, (friction) on surface.
• Acts tangentially to surface.
• Pressure and shear are in units of force per unit area ( N/m2).
• Net unbalance creates an aerodynamic force.
 “No matter how complex the flow field, and no matter how complex the shape of the body, the only 
way nature has of communicating an aerodynamic force to a solid object or surface is through the 
pressure and shear stress distributions that exist on the surface”.
 “The pressure and shear stress distributions are the two hands of nature that reach out and grab 
the body, exerting a force on the body – the aerodynamic force”.

RESOLVING THE 
AERODYNAMIC FORCE
V∞•Aerodynamic force, R, may also be 
resolved into components perpendicular 
and parallel to the chord line.
•Normal Force, N: Perpendicular to the 
chord line.
•Axial Force, A: Parallel to the chord line.
•L and D are easily related to N and A.
•For airfoils and wings, L and D are the 
most common.
•For rockets, missiles, bullets, etc. N and A 
more useful.

•Mac = constant (independent of ).
•For low -speed airfoils , the aerodynamic center  is near the quarter -chord point.VARIATION OF L, D AND 
M WITH •To understand  drag  and actual  airfoil/wing  behavior,  we need  an understanding  of viscous  flows  
(all real flows  have  friction ).
•Inviscid  (frictionless)  flow  around  a body  will result  in zero  drag!
•Called  d’Alembert’s  paradox .
• Friction  (viscosity,  m) must  be included  in theory .
•Flow  adheres  to the surface  because  of friction  between  gas and solid  boundary .
•At surface  flow, velocity  is zero  → called  ‘No-Slip Condition ’.
•Thin  region  of retarded  flow  in the vicinity  of the surface,  called  a ‘Boundary  Layer’.
•At the outer  edge  of B.L., V∞
•At the solid  boundary,  V = 0
 “The  presence  of friction  in the flow  causes  a shear  stress  at the surface  of a body,  which,  in turn,  
contributes  to the aerodynamic  drag  of the body : skin friction  drag” .REAL EFFECTS:

V∞•NACA  2415  flying  upside  down  at certain  AoA will generate  positive  lift but less than  the same  airfoil  right  side up at the 
same  AoA.
•Here  is a way to understand  this:
•If we take  the airfoil  on the left and turn  it upside  down,  it is the same  as the airfoil  right  side up but with  a negative  AoA.
•Therefore,  the lift coefficient  for upside  down  airfoil  at a positive  angle  of attack  is given  by data  for negative  AoA.
•The negative  cl connotes  a downward  lift on the ordinary  right -side-up airfoil  when  pitched  to a negative  Aoa.
•In an upside -down  orientation  (airfoil  on the right),  the lift is directed  upward .

•Zero -lift , L=0 = -2°
•The airfoil  will generate  positive  lift 
(when  right  side up) for  > -2º
•Now  turn  the airfoil  upside  down
•If  = 0º, negative  lift
•If  = 2º, zero  lift
•If  is greater  than  2º (but reading  –
 range),  the airfoil  will generate  
lift in the positive  vertical  direction
•Upside -down  airfoil  at same   generates  
less lift

UPSIDE DOWN?36The question  is sometimes  asked : Can an airfoil  product  lift when  
flying  upside -down?  This exercise  will answer  that question .
a.Consider,  a NACA  2415  airfoil  flying  right  side up at an angle  of 
attack  of 6°. The airfoil  has a chord  length  of 1.5 m and is flying  at 
a standard  altitude  of 2 km at a velocity  of 150 m/s. Calculate  the 
lift per unit span .
b.Now,  turn  this airfoil  upside -down  at the same  flight  conditions  at 
an angle  of attack  of 6°. Calculate  the lift per unit span .
c.Compare  and discuss  the results .EXERCISE 3•Aerodynamic  forces  and moments  as a 
consequence  of pressure  distribution
•Total  aerodynamic  force  on the airfoil  is the 
summation  of F1 and F2
•Lift is obtained  when  F2 > F1
•Misalignment  of F1 and F2 creates  
Moments,  M, which  tend  to rotate  
airfoil/wing
•Value  of the induced  moment  depends  on 
the point  about  which  it is taken
•Moments  about  leading  edge,  MLE or
