Application ofthermodynamics (1stand 2ndlaws) and compressible
aerodynamics →isentropic flow .
Definitions toremember :
•Adiabatic process–one onwhich noheat isadded ortaken away :dq=0.
•Reversible process–one inwhich nofrictional orother dissipative effects occur .
•Isentropic process–one that isboth adiabatic and reversible .
Anisentropic process isone inwhich there isneither heat exchange nor
any effect due tofriction .Isentropic flow isrelevant totheanalysis of
compressible flows only.COMPRESSIBILITY CONCEPTS

From thedefinition ofenthalpy :h=e+pv
Having that pv=RT,h=cpTande=cvT,then :cpT=cvT+RT

Applying the energy equation
forpoints 1and0:
Because thegasisisentropically compressed atthe
nose ofthePitot probe, thelastequation :
holds between thefree stream and thestagnation
point, that isp0/p1=(r0/r1)g=(T0/T1)g/(g-1);therefore,
itcanbeobtained :
SUBSONIC COMPRESSIBLE FLOW
These equations arefundamental and important relations forcompressible,
isentropic flow
Holds foradiabatic flow
Contain the additional assumption
offrictionless (isentropic) flow
These equations also demonstrate the powerful influence ofthe Mach
number inaerodynamic flow calculations .Itisvery important tonote that
thetemperature, pressure, and density ratios arefunctions ofM1only.
