LIFTING LINE THEORY  (LLT) 
TUTORIAL & EXAMPLE  
Prepared by Juan Pablo Alvarado P.  
 
 
This document presents a step -by-step methodology for the application of the Lifting Line Theory 
(LLT) to subsonic straight wings. This material is a complementary material  to the aerodynamics 
lecture.  
 
LLT assumes that even thoug h the flow around an aircraft’s wing is 3-D, it may be satisfactorily 
approximated by a linear summation of flows around the elemental aerofoils, which makes up the 
overall wing, where t he flow around  each aerofoil is assumed to be 2 -D. This approach gives a 
reasonable result provided that the model flow considers the effect of the vortex sheet, which is shed 
at the trailing edge of the wing. The trailing vortex sheet  induces a downwash velocity, which  varies  
along the span wise direction.  
 
The wing is assumed to be a flat plate lying on the x-y plane. Therefore, the theory does not consider  
the wing’s thickness distribution. It is also unable to handle any dihedral or sweepback angle. 
However, it can m odel a tapered wing with geometrical and aerodynamic twists  (c/4 = 0 [deg]). 
 
For the analysis of a wing with LLT the following wing information i s need it:  
 
Wing geometry:  
• Wing span ( bw) 
• Wing taper ratio ( w) 
• Wing reference area ( Sw) 
• Wing twist angle ( tip) 
• Wing geometric angle of attack ( geo) 
 
Aerofoil aerodynamic characteristics:  
• Aerofoil reference – name or reference of the tip and root aerofoils  
• Lift slope ( a0) [1/rad ] – tip and root aerofoils  
• Angle of attack for L = 0  (L=0) [deg] 
• Profile drag ( Cd_0) 
 
Flying (airflow) characteristics:  
• Air density ( ∞) 
• Air speed ( V∞) 
• Air dynamic viscosity ( ∞) 
 
The LLT procedure  is described in the following steps:

With the previous in formation, the computational procedure can begin:  
 
Divide the wing into a  define  number of spanwise stations. Here k + 1 stations are shown, 
with n designating any specific station  
 
 
 
For k = 1, 2, 3, .., N  points, calculate the following : The N points al ong th e span are chosen 
so that they are  equally spaced. In other words, the wing span is divided up into N equal 
intervals, and the midp oint of each interval is chosen to be a control point. The port (left) 
wing tip is located at  y = -bw /2 whereas the st arboard (right) wing tip is located at y = b w /2. 
 
The coordinates of th e control points are then given as follows, f or each value of k, from 1 to 
N, we have :

The specification for aerodynamic twist  is quite complicat ed, since it requires knowledge of the shape 
of the aerofoil section at each station y along t he span. In the absence of such infor mation, this 
problem  can simplify the problem somewhat by requiring that the tip aerofoil differs only slightly 
from the root aerofoil such that the lif t coefficient and zero angle of attack at y are given by the 
following linear relationships

The geometric angle of attack (geo) may vary as a funct ion of y if the wing is given a geometric twist. 
A wing without twist is one where t he geo is constant for all values of y, such that the leading edge 
and the trailing edge of the wing are straight lines, which lie on the same hor izontal pl ane when geo 
= 0. 
 
A wing may be given a wash -out, where the wing is twisted such that t he leading edge of th e wing 
tip aerofoil is now lower than the leading edge of the root aer ofoil (the root aerofoil is the aerofoil 
located at the plane of s ymmetry if it is imagined  that the fuselage is not there and the two halves of 
the wing meet at the plane of symmetry). A wing with wash -in is one where the leading edge of the 
tip aerofoil is now high er than the leading edge of the root aerofoil, whereas the trailing edge of the 
wing rema ins on the horizontal plane. It follows, therefore, that the chord of the aerofoil at y may 
have negative or positive geometric angle of attack values when geo = 0 at the wing  root, depending 
on whether the wing has a wash -out or a wash -in.  
 
 
Let the height difference between the leading edge of  the wing tip aerofoil from the leading edg e of 
the root aerofoil is htip, which is negati ve for wash -out and pos itive for wash -in. 
 
 
 
It should be noted that the leading edge of the wing is re quired to remain as a straight line. Therefore, 
the twist angle or the geometric angle  of attack at y relative to the geometric angle of attack at the 
wing root can be calcula ted as follows :

Let´s apply now LLT to find the solution in the form of span wise wing load or lift per unit span length 
distribution, the ove rall wing’s l ift coefficient (CL_w) and the induced drag coefficient of the wing  
(CDi_w). From the Kutta -Joukowski  Lift Theorem it is known that lift is directly proportional to 
circulation or vortex strength . Therefore, the theory must be capable of predicting the span -wise 
bound vortex strengt h per unit length distribution. The unknown vorte x strength distribution, (y), is 
approximat ed by a Fourier  series :

The basic problem is how to calculate the unknown  Fourier  series coefficients or amplitudes, An. The 
approximation using a Fourier seri es becomes more accurate as the number of terms, N, increases.

This equation contains N unknowns, namely A(n) for n = 1 to N. It is therefore necessary to apply the 
last equation at N different control points or values of distance along the span, y, so that we have a 
system of equations that can be solved simultaneously to calculate the valu es of A(n). The points 
chosen should n ot include the wing tips, since regardless of the values of the Fourier coefficients, t he 
vortex strength distribution ( ( )) is always  satisfied at those points. Selecting those 2 points will 
not provide any new info rmation regarding the values of the  Fourier amplitudes. It is also 
recommended that the midpoint ( y = 0 ) should also not be s elected as a control point, for similar 
reasons. To get the most accurate result for a give n number of control points, the followin g method 
for selecting the control points is recommended. Firstly, N should be chosen to be an even integer, 
such that  for example  N = 2M , say.  
 
The N points along the span a re chosen so that they are  equally spaced. In other words, the span is 
divided up into N equal intervals, and the midp oint of each interval is chosen to be a contr ol point. 
The port (left) wing tip is located at  y = -bw /2 whereas the starboard (right) wing tip is located at y = 
bw /2. 
 
 
 
The equation of ( ) can be rewritten in a way, which separates the even terms from the odd terms 
as follows:

It should be noted that c(k) is the aerofoil’s chord length  at the station y(k), or  (k ), whereas geo and 
L = 0  (k) are the geometric and zero  lift angle of attacks at y(k). The geometric angle of attack may 
vary as a funct ion of y if the wing is given a geometric twi st. A wing without twist is one where t he 
geometric angle of attack is constant for all values of y, such that the leading edge an d the trailing 
edge of the wing are straight lines, which lie on the same horizontal pl ane when geo = 0. 
 
A wing may be given a wash -out, where the wing is twisted such that the leading edge of  the wing 
tip aerofoil is no w lower than the leading edge of t he root aer ofoil (the root aerofoil is the aerofoil 
located at the plane of symmetry if it is imagined  that the fuselage is not there and the two halves of 
the wing meet at the plane of s ymmetry ). 
 
A wing with wash -in is one where the leading edge of the t ip aerofoil is now high er than the leading 
edge of the root aerofoil, whereas the trailing edge of the wing rema ins on the horizontal plane. It 
follows, therefore, that the chord of the aerofoil  at y may have negative or positive geometric angle 
of attack values when geo = 0 at the wing  root, depending on whether the wing has a wash -out or a 
wash -in. 
 
The height difference between the leading edge of the wing tip aer ofoil from the leading edge o f the 
root aerofoil is htip, which is negati ve for wash -out an d positive for wash -in. It should be noted that 
the leading edge of the wing is required to remain as a straight line. Therefore, the twist angle or the geometric angle  of attack at y relative t o the geometric angle of att ack at the wing root can be 
calculated as follows

The angle of attack of the wing or the aircraft be denote d by the angle of attack at the wing root, and 
is given the symbol of geo. This an gle obviously can be varied and represents the attitude of the 
aircra ft (when the aircraft is at a level cruising flight this angle may have a small positive value of not 
more than 3 degrees). Using this definition,  it can now calculate the ge ometric angle of attack at y as

A wing may be given an aerodynamic twist as well as a g eometric twist. This means that the aerofoil 
shape at the win g root is different from that at  the wing tip. The shape of the aerofoil in between the 
two limiting stations is then determ ined by insisting that the wing cross -section should have a 
smoothly varying shape along  the span wise direction. Since the aerofoil  shape at the wing tip is 
differ ent from that at t he root, therefore the value of the sectional lift coefficient as well as its zero -
lift angle of attack may al so vary along the span wise direction. Provided the variation of a0 (y) and 
L = 0  (y) are given , equation of C (k, 2n -1) can st ill be used to compute the matrix coefficients, thus 
the lifting line theory can handle such a problem.  
 
The theory can also handle the problem involving a varia tion in the chord length of the sections as a 
function of y, if the functional form of  c(y) is given. This means that the theory is also applicable for 
analysing tapered win g shape, so long as the quarter chord line is normal or almost normal to the 
aircraft’s l ongitudinal axis. Obviously, the theory is not valid for a highly swept wing. For sw ept 
wings, a more elaborated methodology like  Vortex L attice Method  (VLM ) should be used .

For the acrobati c monoplane Extra EA -300, calculate (1) the aerodynamic characteristics of flight to 
see if the actual geometry can counteract the Maximum Take -Off Weight ( MTOW ) for a normal cruise  
condition with a wing  incidence angle  of 2 [deg]; and (2) find the distrib uted aerodynamic load (Lift 
force) over the wing. An airplane 3 -view picture is shown:

• Wing span ( bw) = 8.0 [m] 
• Taper ratio ( w) = 0.45 
• Wing reference area ( Sw) = 10.7 [m2] 
• Aerofoil information:

Analysing this result and comparing it with the opposing force (airplane´s MTOW ) the geometric 
angle of attack of two degrees it´s not enough to lift -off the airplane from the ground; Lw < MTOW . 
 
It means that for a geometric angle of attack (incidence ang le) of two degrees the airplane still needs 
more lift force to counteract the MTOW . Some considerations must be co nsidered to assure the wing 
with its geometric and aerodynamic characteristics can achieve enough lift force, then a study of 
different incide nce angles must be made to study the possibilities of wing attitude with respect to the 
horizontal plane of the ai rcraft.  
 The following figure illustrates the differences between the geometric (incidence) angle of attack, the 
effective angle of attack an d the induced angle of attack:  
 
 
 
Examining the profile drag curves of both aerofoils , it is decided that the tot al profile drag coefficient 
for the wing is cd_0 = 0.0054  for a geometric angle of two degrees.  
 
Now, let´s calculate the total wing drag force at the established conditions:  
 
The Oswald  efficiency planform factor is crucial for the calculation of the wing  induced drag at the 
flight conditions given. The equation to find it is:

As the result shows a high value, it is recommended to check it with some other methodology  that

Analysing the wing load distribution:  
 
The main idea with this  analysis is to establish how the lift load distribution over the wing is going to 
be. For this it is expected to obtain a distribution that describe an elliptical shape to make it as 
aerodynamically efficient as possible. First define the stations in whic h you want to study the local 
lift load, for this help yourself with already y stations already stablished. In thi s case we are analysing 
half span beginning at the root of the wing:

y(0) = bw /2 0 4.0

Keeping in mind that  the load distribution is symmetrical then circulation on each station over the 
wing can be calculated by the equation:

In addition, the lift distribution is plotted  along the half wingspan in order to get the values of the

As stablished before, the net lift produced by this wing is not enough to counteract the MTOW,  a 
further study should be done to assure proper values of the wing  incidence angle of attack.  
 
Using the LLT mathematical model , we can find different values of the net wing lift coefficient at 
different angles of attack. The following graphs show the results of  this procedure:

With all this information, a new value of the net wing lift coefficient can be found. We must first be

With this same relation, the net wing lift coefficient is calculated. It is to note that in this graph (CL_w

With this new value of the geometric (wing incidence) angle of attack, the values of the wing 
aerodynamic character istics are:

You could study more about the response to change of some variables like the altitude (height), 
velocity, different aerofoils, applying of a geometric twist angle  and even the change in the geometric 
shape of the wing to check the consequences in the aerod ynamic characteristics of this airplane wing.
