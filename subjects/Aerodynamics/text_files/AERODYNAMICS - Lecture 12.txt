THEOREMS
1.The strength of a vortex filament is constant along its length
2.A vortex filament cannot end in a fluid; it must extend to boundaries of fluid (which can be ±∞) or 
form a closed path
Note: The statement that “vortex lines do not end in the fluid” is kinematic due to the definition 
of vorticity, x, and general
•Helmholtz’ s vortex theorems are going to be used for the calculation of lift distribution, which will 
provide expressions for induced drag

THEORY
•Replace finite wing (span = b) with bound vortex filament extending from y = -b/2to y = b/ 2and 
origin located at the center of the bound vortex (center of the wing)
•Helmholtz’ s vorticity theorem: A vortex filament cannot end in a fluid
•Filament continues as two free vortices trailing from wing tips to infinity
•This is called a ‘ Horseshoe Vortex ’
HorseshoeTrailing vortices induce velocity along

•This has problems: It does not simulate the downwash distribution of a real finite wing
•Problem is that as y → ±b/2, w → ∞
•Physical basis for solution: The finite wing is not represented by uniform single -bound vortex filament but rather has a distrib ution of (y)PRANDTL’S LIFTING LINE 
THEORY•Represent wing by a large number of horseshoe vortices, each with a different length of bound vortex, but with all bound vort ices coincident 
along a single line
•This line is called the Lifting Line 
•Circulation, , varies along the line of bound vortices
•Also have a series of trailing vortices distributed over the span
•Strength of each trailing vortex = change in circulation along lifting line

SUMMARY SO FAR
•We’ve done a lot of theory so far; what have we accomplished?
•We have replaced a finite wing with a mathematical model
•We did the same thing with a 2-Dairfoil
•Mathematical model is called a Lifting Line
•Circulation (y)varies continuously along lifting line
•Obtained an expression for downwash, w, below the lifting line
•What we want is an expression so we can calculate (y)for finite wing (WHY?)
•Calculate Lift, L(Kutta -Joukowski theorem)
•Calculate CL
•Calculate aeff
•Calculate Induced Drag, CD,i(drag due to lift)FINITE WING DOWNWASH
•Recall: Wing tip vortices induce a downward component of air velocity near wing by 
dragging surrounding air with them

Lifting Line Theory (LLT )SUMMARY OF THE INDUCE 
DRAG
•Induced drag is the price you pay for the generation of lift
•CD,iproportional to CL2
• Airplane on take -off or landing, induced drag major component
• Significant at cruise ( 15-25% of total drag)
•CD,iinversely proportional to AR
• Desire high ARto reduce induced drag
• Compromise between structures and aerodynamics
• ARis an important tool as a designer (more control than span efficiency, e)
• Normal ARvalues are in the order of 6to 8for conventional subsonic aircraft (exceptions may 
appear with gliders with AR = 14.3 to 51)
•For an elliptic lift distribution, the chord must vary elliptically along the span
• Wing planform is elliptical
• Elliptical lift distribution gives a good approximation for arbitrary finite wing through the use of span 
efficiency factor, eELLIPTICAL LIFT DISTRIBUTION 
PROPERTY
•Consider a wing with no aerodynamic or geometric twist; this gives aiand aL=0
constant along the span
•Assuming a0is the same for each section (a0=2), clconst. along the span
•Lift per unit span is                          , then

•From lasteq.clconstant along thespan ;
however, L’(y)varies elliptically, then

•Considering the transformation                           , where the coordinates in bdirection are now 
given by q, with 0 ≤ q≤ .
•In terms of q, the elliptic lift distribution can be written as
•To solve the last eq. Fourier sine series would be an appropriate expression for the general 
circulation along an arbitrary finite wing
