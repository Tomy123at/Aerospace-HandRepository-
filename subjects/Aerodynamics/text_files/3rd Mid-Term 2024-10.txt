Directions:  This mid -term exam is to be completed without help from any other individual. This 
includes help from other students (whether or not they are taking Aerodynamics), the monitor 
(Teaching Assistant ), other faculty staff, people on the Internet, etc. You are NOT permitted to use 
your books, class notes, library resources, etc. You only need  a pen, pencil, eraser, and your 
calculator. You must provide the numerical or text answer as asked in each prob lem or question. The 
extra sheets given to you will  be used  as a calculation aid. The procedure will be graded , as well as 
the answer, by  the grade breakdown table below . Answers in the English language is compulsory 
for this exam. Answers with wrong or incorrect  units will be penalized. The error percentage of the 
numerical answers is 5.0%.  The exam will be  in a maximum of one hour and fifty minutes. Absolutely 
no late exams will be accepted.

For points  1, 2 and 3, use the following information:  
 
As part of a group of aerodynamicists, you are assigned a wing design  for a general aviation airplane. 
This aircraft  is powered by a single engine -propeller -driven  combination located at the front of the 
vehicle. The aircraft design has a conventional configuration with a horizontal stabilizer at the tail . 
The MTOW of this airplane is 2041 [kg]. The wingspan is 12.8 meters , with a chord at the root of 1.3 
meters. The horizontal tail span  is 4.68 meters, the chord at the tip is 0.8 meters long , and the taper 
ratio is 1.0 . The following table gives some useful information about the wing and stabilizers:  
 
Surface  Airfoil type  a0

Wing  Asymmetrical  0.1123  -4.1 5.032×10−3𝑐𝑙2−3.307×10−3𝑐𝑙+5.389×10−3 
Horizontal 
tail Symmetrical  0.1118  0 4.680×10−3𝑐𝑙2−4.225×10−5𝑐𝑙+5.040×10−3 
 
The cruise speed of this aircraft is 82.0 [m/s] at sea level conditions ( ∞ = 1.225 [kg/m3]). So far, the 
research group knows that the horizontal stabilizer needs to provide  a down lift force  (Lht) of -5820 
[N] ( eht = 0.92).  
 
You must  decide which of the six wing platforms best suits  the design. The researchers already 
developed  an LLT study that tested the wings at a geometric angle of attack of 4 degrees, giving the 
following results:  
 
Wing No.  w ew w [deg]  A(1)  
1 1.0 0.92 0 0.023379

5 0.65 0.96 0 0.020221  
6 -1.0 0.019288  
 
Calculate for a cruise flight condition the following:  
 
1. The wing’s net lift force required  for the cruise condition:  Lw = __________ [N]  
2. Complete the following table:

3. Analyzing your results, which of the six wings is optimized and why? Explain and j ustify your 
answer , giving technical reasons and engineering criteria for this aircraft's operational behavior . 
For points  4 and 5, use the following information:  
 
The Short SC.7 Skyvan  airplane is a twin-turboprop  engine freighter with a fixed landing gear 
designed to carry heavy payloads and possibly  fly to difficult areas. The followings  are the 
specifications and flying characteristics of this aircraft: total Take -off weight of 5670 [kg], cruise 
speed of 317 kilometers  per hour, a service ceiling of 22500 [ft] ( ∞ = 0.6 [kg/m3]), the cabin 
height/width is 1.97 [m], the wings extend 8.905 [m] from the fuselage on each side and the root 
chord is 1.47 [m] ( e = 0.82 ).  
 
According to the drag coefficient study, this airplane has the following sources of parasite drag:  
 
No. Component  CD_0 Parasite drag [%]  
1 Fuselage  0.0057  15.00%  
2 Spinner  0.00057  1.50%  
3 Wing  0.00874  23.00%  
4 Horizontal tail  0.0024396  6.42%  
5 Vertical tail  0.001976  5.20%  
6 Landing gear  0.00684  18.00%  
7 Wing struts  0.0038  10.00%  
8 External appendages  0.000076  0.20%  
9 Interference  0.00076  2.00%  
10 Engine cooling  0.00304  8.00%  
11 Antennas  0.0000304  0.08%  
12 Pitot  0.000038  0.10%  
13 Miscellaneous  0.0019  5.00%  
14 Leakage  0.00057  1.50%  
15 Rivets and screws  0.00152  4.00%  
 
Use the correction factor K c = 1.2. With the previous information, c alculate:  
 
4. The total aircraft drag force - Dtotal = ________________ [N]  
 
5. Which component will you recommend modifying, why , and what would be your optimization 
proposal ? (Explain  your answer) .
