UPBVORTEX LATTICE METHOD
•LLT is limited for straight wings with moderate to high AR.
•For other types of wings (i.e., low AR straight, swept, and delta), a more sophisticated 
method can be used: The Vortex Lattice Method ( VLM ).
VORTEX LATTICE 
METHOD
•For LLT,the circulation Gvaries with y
along thelifting line.
•InVLM ,aseries ofLifting Lines (LL) areplaced on
the plane ofthe wing atdifferent chordwise
stations (alarge number ofLLparallel tothey
axis, located atdifferent values ofx).
•Inthe limit ofan infinite number oflines of
infinitesimal strength, avortex sheet isobtained,
where lines runparallel totheyaxis.
•The strength ofthe sheet (per unit length inthex
direction) isdenoted byg(varies intheydirection,
analogous tothevariation ofGinasingle lifting line) .
•Each LLwillhave adifferent overall strength, sogvaries
with xalso [g=g(x,y)].VORTEX LATTICE METHOD
Reminder –thewing istreated asaflatsurface•Each LLhas asystem oftrailing vortices ;hence, the
series ofLLiscrossed byaseries ofsuperimposed
trailing vortices parallel tothexaxis.
•Inthe limit ofaninfinite number ofinfinitesimally
weak vortices, these trailing vortices form another
vortex sheet ofstrength d(per unit length inthey
direction) .VORTEX LATTICE METHOD
Reminder –thewing istreated asaflatsurfaceVORTEX LATTICE METHOD
•Consider asingle line parallel tothexaxis;moving along it
from the leading edge tothe trailing edge, anew
superimposed trailing vortex ispicked each time itcrosses
aLL(colored lines inthepicture) .
•This iswhydmust vary with x;trailing vortices aresimply
parts ofthe horseshoe vortex systems, the leading edges
ofwhich make upthevarious LL.
•SinceGabout each LLvaries inthe ydirection, the
strengths ofdifferent trailing vortices willalso bedifferent ;
hence,dalso varies intheydirection [d=d(x,y)].
•The two vortex sheets –theone with vortex lines running
parallel toywith strength g,and the other with vortex
lines running parallel toxwith strength d–result ina
lifting surface distributed over theentire wing planform .VORTEX LATTICE METHOD

given bybothgandd,which arefunctions ofxandy.
➢g=g(x,y)–spanwise vortex strength distribution
➢d=d(x,y)–chordwise vortex strength distribution
•Downstream ofthe trailing edge, there are nospanwise
vortex lines, only trailing vortices ;hence, the wake
consists ofonly chordwise vortices .
•The strength ofthis wake vortex sheet isgiven bydw(per
unit length intheydirection) .
•Since inthe wake, the trailing vortices donot cross any
vortex lines, the strength ofany given trailing vortex is
constant with x;hence,dwdepends only onyand,
throughout the wake ,dw(y)isequal toitsvalue atthe
trailing edge .VORTEX LATTICE METHOD

WING TIPS

•It affects the aircraft wetted area
•The influence the tip shape has upon the lateral spacing of the tip vorticesTYPES OF WINGLET

B737 WINGLET OPTIONS737 MAX Advanced Technology (AT) Winglets
Benefits:
Boeing claims they will give 1.5%fuel burn
improvement over current technology winglets .
They explain this asfollows :“The ATwinglet further
redistributes the span -wise loading, increasing the
effective span ofthewing .
The ATwinglet balances theeffective span increase
uniquely between the upper and lower parts and,
therefore, generates more liftand reduces drag .
This makes the system more efficient without
adding more weight .“,

WINGLETS, FENCES, OR NO 
WINGLETS?•Pros and cons:
•Allow for steeper climb
•Good for obstacle -limited, high, hot, weight -limited, and/or noise -
restricted airports
•Lower wing spar bending moment than wingspan extension
•Eye catching
•For the same amount of structural material, nonplanar wingtip devices 
can achieve a similar induced drag benefit as a planar span increase•Tend to cause wing flutter
•Winglet design is very detailed and complicated
•Difficult to determine boundary layer effects at wingtip/winglet 
junction (separation, pressure gradient)
•Usually not in initial design

Winglet geometry depends on the following factors: Airfoil shape, aspect ratio, taper ratio, 
swept angle, twist, dihedral, and toe angle.
•Main goal: To generate enough lift while maintaining the lowest possible drag
•Should not stall before wing during low -speed flight
•Geometry driven by aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil
•Limitations:
•Narrow chords yield low Re
•Rerange from 1x105to 1x106WINGLETS DESIGN ASPECTSWinglet geometry depends on the following factors: Airfoil shape, aspect ratio, 
taper ratio, swept angle, twist, dihedral, and toe angle.
•Sizing
•Too small:
•Airfoil will require a large lift coefficient
•Too big :
•High winglet loading
•Causes the outboard section of the wing to stall prematurely
•Span -wise elliptical chord distribution
•Elliptical planform will help with load distribution over a large range of 
flight regimesWINGLETS DESIGN ASPECTSAirfoil shape, aspect ratio, taper 
ratio, swept angle, twist, 
dihedral, and toe angle.
•Determined by the optimal 
induced drag and profile drag 
relationship
•Have similar effects on the 
winglet
•Tailor the load distribution
