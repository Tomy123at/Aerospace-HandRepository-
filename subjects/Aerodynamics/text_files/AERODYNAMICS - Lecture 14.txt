UPBAPPLIED AERODYNAMICS: 
AIRPLANE LIFT AND DRAG
•Three dimensional objects are of primary interest to 
aerospace engineers (i.e., the whole airplane)
Aerodynamic forces on any body moving through the air are created due only from 
two basic sources:
•Pressure distribution
•Shear stress distribution

DELEWING -BODY INTERACTION
•There is not accurate analytical equation that can predict the lift of a wing body 
combination
•Solution to this task is the use of computational fluid dynamic or wind tunnel testing
Forsubsonic speeds, data obtained using different fuselage thickness (d),mounted onwings
with different spans (b)show that the total liftforawing -body combination isessentially
constant ford/branging from 0(wing only) to6(normally fatfuselage, with short, stubby
wing) .
WING -BODY INTERACTIONThe liftonawing -body combination canbetreated assimply theliftonthecomplete wing
itself, including theportion that willbemasked bythefuselage
WING -BODY INTERACTIONAIRPLANE DRAG
Drag is a costly force
One of the jobs of an aerospace engineer is to determine the drag force produced by an aircraft at 
different altitudes, speeds, and configurations .
It is not an easy task because this force is a function of several parameters, including aircraft 
configuration and components.

Cf–skin friction coefficient, Redependent :
For simplicity, itisrecommended toassume that the flow iseither
completely laminar orcompletely turbulent .The assumption ofcomplete
turbulent flow provides abetter result since over -estimation ofdrag is
much better than underestimation .
•Re<200000 ,assume laminar flow
•Re>2000000 ,assume turbulent flow
Asarule ofthumb, inlow subsonic flight, theflow ismostly laminar, but
inhigh subsonic and transonic speeds, itbecomes mostly turbulent .
Supersonic and hypersonic flight experiences acomplete turbulent flow
over every aircraft component .

The landing gear (orundercarriage) isthestructure (usually struts

Landing gear usually includes wheels and isequipped with shock
absorbers forsolid ground, but some aircraft are equipped with
skisforsnow, floats forwater, and/or skids .
Todecrease drag inflight, some landing gears areretracted into
thewings and/or fuselage with wheels orconcealed behind doors ;
this iscalled retractable gear.

Appears when two bodies intersect orareplaced inproximity ;their pressure distributions and boundary layers can
interact, resulting inanetdrag ofthecombination that isoften higher than thesum oftheseparate drags .
Atthefuselage -wing juncture, adrag increment results astheboundary layers from thetwo components interact and
thicken locally atthejunction .
This type ofdrag penalty willbecome more severe ifsurfaces meet atanangle other than 90°.

CD0CalculationCD0_antennas –Antennas contribution
Communication antennas ofmany aircraft are located
outside oftheaircraft .They areindirect contact with the
air,hence they produce drag .
There aremainly two types ofantennas :
•rodorwire
•blade orplate
Both types ofantennas should beinanopen space (below
orabove thefuselage) forbetter communication .
Tocalculate CD0_antennas,rod antenna istreated asathin
strut, and theblade antenna isconsidered asasmall wing .CD0CalculationCD0_pt –Pitot tube contribution
CD0Calculation
Apitot probe AKA“pitottube” (combined with astatic
port) isapressure measurement instrument used to
measure airspeed and sometimes altitude ofanaircraft .
Since thepitot tube isindirect contact with theoutside
air,itcontributes toaircraft drag (i.e.,CD0).
The horizontal part ofthepitot tube may beassumed asa
little fuselage, and itsvertical part asastrut .CD0_sr –Surface roughness contribution
The outer surface ofanaircraft structure (skin) has a
considerable role inaircraft drag .
Forthis reason, theaircraft skin isoften finished and painted .
The paint not only protects the skin from atmospheric
hazards (e.g.,rusting) butalso reduces itsdrag .
Astheskin’s surface ismore polished, the aircraft drag
(surface friction) willbereduced .
Noknown method can predict this;itismaterial orfinished
procedure -dependent .
CD0CalculationCD0_lk –Leakages contribution
There are usually gaps between control
surfaces (such aselevator, aileron, and
rudder), flaps, spoilers, and lifting surfaces
(such aswing and tails) .
The airflows through these tiny gaps, thus
producing extra drag .
Leakage drag usually contributes about
1%-2%tototal drag .
CD0CalculationCD0_r-s –Rivets and screws contribution
The outside oftheaircraft structure (fuselage and wing)
iscovered with skin.
The skin;ifitismade from metallic materials ;isattached
totheprimary components ofanaircraft structure (such
asspar and frame) viaparts such asrivets orscrews .
The Composite structures have theadvantage that they
donotrequire any rivet orscrew and areoften attached
together through techniques such asbonding .
CD0CalculationCD0_r-s –Rivets and screws contribution
Inthecase ofthescrew, thetop part ofthescrew could beoften
hidden inside skin.
The heads ofmost types ofrivets areout ofthe skin;therefore,
they produce extra drag .
Rivets and screws usually contribute about 2%-3%tototal drag .
CD0CalculationCD0_pylon –Pylon(s) contribution
Apodded turbine engine (e.g.,turbofan engine) is
usually mounted totheairplane wing orfuselage with a
pylon .
Apylon ismainly astructural component but may be
designed tocontribute toaircraft lift.
Although apylon isnotfundamentally alifting surface,
forthe purpose ofzero -liftdrag calculation, itmay be
treated asasmall wing .
CD0CalculationCD0_miscellaneous –Miscellaneous contribution

CD0for various configurations
When anaircraft retracts itslanding gear, deflects itsflap, rotates itscontrol surfaces, exposes any
external component (such asagun), releases itsstore (e.g.,missile), oropens itscargo door, it
changes itsconfiguration .
Ingeneral, there arethree configuration groups that anaircraft may adopt :
1.clean configuration
2.take -offconfiguration
3.landing configuration
1.Clean configuration
The aircraft isinacruise flight condition .
Inthis configuration, noflap isdeflected, and the
landing gear isretracted (ifitisretractable) .
CD0_cleanincludes every component (such aswing,
