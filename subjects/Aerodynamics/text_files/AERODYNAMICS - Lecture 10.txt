AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 587 
•Summary –American Airlines Flight 587
crashed into theBelle Harbor neighborhood of
Queens, NYC, shortly after takeoff from JFK
International Airport onNovember 12,2001 .
This isthe second deadliest U.S.aviation
accident todate .
•On November 12,2001 ,atabout 0916 :15
Eastern Standard Time, American Airlines flight
587 (A300-605R)crashed into aresidential
area ofBelle Harbor, New York, shortly after
takeoff from JFK International Airport .The
plane’s vertical stabilizer and rudder separated
inflight ;the plane’s engines subsequently
separated inflight .All260 people aboard the
plane and 5people ontheground were killed,
and theplane was destroyed byimpact forces
and apost -crash fire.
AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 587 
The official National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report ofOctober 26,2004 ,stated that the
cause ofthecrash was theoveruse oftherudder tocounter wake turbulence .
The A300-600,which took offjust minutes after aJapan Airlines Boeing 747 onthesame runway,
flew into thelarger jet's wake, anarea ofvery turbulent air.The first officer attempted tokeep the
plane upright with therudder .The strength oftheairflowing against themoving rudder stressed the
aircraft's vertical stabilizer and eventually snapped itoffentirely, causing theaircraft tolose control
and crash .

Investigators were concerned regarding the
manner inwhich thetailfinseparated .The
tailfinisconnected tothefuselage with six
attaching points, each sethas two sets of
nuts, one made outofcomposite material,
another from aluminum which isconnected
by atitanium bolt, however damage
analysis showed the bolts and aluminum
lugs were intact butnotthecomposite lugs.
There were fears that thecomposites were
faulty because they areused inother areas
oftheplane including theengine mounting
and the wings, however examinations of
construction and the materials gave the
plane aclean billofhealth .

•Oman's Civil Aviation Authority had told Omani media on Jan 8th 2017, that a private German registered aircraft had performed an
emergency landing in Muscat on Jan 7th 2017 declaring emergency at 14:10L (10:10Z) and landing in Muscat at 15:14L (11:14Z). 
The crew had declared emergency due to injuries on board and problems with an engine (a number of media subsequently 
reported the right hand engine had failed, another number of media reported the left hand engine had failed)
Canadair Challenger 604 D -AMSC
•According to information The Aviation Herald received on March 4th 2017 the CL -604 passed 1000 feet below an Airbus 
A380 -800 while enroute over the Arabian Sea, when a short time later (1 -2 minutes) the aircraft encountered wake 
turbulence sending the aircraft in uncontrolled roll turning the aircraft around at least 3 times (possibly even 5 times), bo th 
engines flamed out, the Ram Air Turbine could not deploy possibly as result of G -forces and structural stress, the aircraft 
lost about 10,000 feet until the crew was able to recover the aircraft exercising raw muscle force, restart the engines and 
divert to Muscat

•On Jan 7th 2017 there were also other A380 -800s crossing the Arabian Sea from northwest to southeast: a Qantas A380 -800, registr ation VH -OQJ 
performing flight QF -2 from Dubai to Sydney, was enroute at FL330 about 1000nm southeast of Muscat and about 400nm northwest of Male at 08:40Z. 
An Emirates A380 -800 registration A6 -EDO performing flight EK -406 from Dubai to Melbourne,VI (Australia) was enroute at FL350 about 470nm 
southeast of Muscat at 08:40Z. Another Emirates A380 -800 registration A6 -EUH performing flight EK -424 from Dubai to Perth,WA (Australia), was 
enroute at FL350 about 350nm southeast of Muscat at 08:40z

actual “rendezvous" with theA380 occurred .
•Based onthe known time ofthe occurrence at

that time, The Aviation Herald believes themost
likely A380 was EK-412 and the “rendezvous"
took place 630nm southeast ofMuscat, which
provides thebest match ofremaining flying time
(2.5hours) and distance for the CL-604 also

FINITE WING DOWNWASH
•Wing tip vortices induce a small downward component of air velocity near wing by dragging 
surrounding air with them
•Downward component of velocity is called downwash, w
Local relative wind
•Two Consequences:
1. Increase in drag, called induced drag (drag due to lift) 
2. Angle of attack is effectively reduced, aeffas compared with V∞Chord lineANGLE OF ATTACK DEFINITIONS
ageometric : angle between incoming relative wind and chord line
This is a case of no wing -tips (infinite wing)
Relative Wind, V∞ ageometricaeffective : what the airfoil ‘sees’ locally
Angle between local flow direction and chord line
Small than ageometric because of downwash
The wing -tips have caused this local relative wind to be angled downward
aeffectiveANGLE OF ATTACK DEFINITIONSageometric : what you see, what you would see in a wind tunnel –Simply look at angle 
between incoming relative wind and chord line
aeffective : what the airfoil ‘sees’ locally –Angle between local flow direction and chord 
line
Small than ageometric because of downwash
ainduced : difference between these two angles –Downwash has ‘induced’ this change 
in angle of attack

1.Local relative wind is canted downward, lift vector is tilted back so a component of Lacts in direction 
normal to incoming relative wind
2.Wing tip vortices alter surface pressure distributions in direction of increased drag
3.Vortices contain rotational energy put into flow by propulsion system to overcome induced drag

•In a wind tunnel, the easiest thing to 
measure is the geometric angle of attack
•For infinite wings, there is no induced 
angle of attack. The angle you see = the 
angle the infinite wing ‘sees’
•With finite wings, there is an induced 
angle of attack. The angle you see ≠ the 
angle the finite wing ‘sees’

Properties of a finite wing differ in two major respects from infinite 
wings:
1.Addition of induced drag
2.Lift curve for a finite wing has smaller slope than corresponding lift
