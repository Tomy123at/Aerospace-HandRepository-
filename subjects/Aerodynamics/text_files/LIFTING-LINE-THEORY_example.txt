LIFTING LINE THEORY ( LLT) 
TUTORIAL & EXAMPLE  
Prepared by  Juan Pablo Alvarado P.  
 
 
This document presents a step -by-step methodology for applying the Lifting Line Theory (LLT) to 
subsonic straight wings. It complements  the aerodynamics lecture.  
 
LLT assumes that even though the flow around an aircraft’s wing is 3-D, it may be satisfactorily 
approximated by a linear summation of flows around the elemental airfoils , which makes up the 
overall wing, where the flow around each airfoil  is assumed to be 2 -D. This approach gives a 
reasonable result , provided that the model flow considers th e effect of the vortex sheet, which is shed 
at the wing's trailing edge . The trailing vortex sheet induces a downwash velocity, which varies  along 
the spanwise  direction.  
 
The wing is assumed to be a flat plate on the x-y plane. Therefore, the theory does not consider  the 
wing’s thickness distribution. It is also unable to handle any dihedral or sweepback angle. However, 
it can model a tapered wing with geometrical and aerodynamic twists  (c/4 = 0 [deg]). 
 
For the analysis of a wing with LLT, the following wing information is needed : 
 
Wing geometry:  
• Wingspan  (bw) 
• Wing taper ratio ( w) 
• Wing reference area ( Sw) 
• Wing twist angle ( tip) 
• Wing geometric angle of attack ( geo) 
 
Airfoil  aerodynamic characteristics:  
• Airfoil  reference – name or reference of the tip and root airfoils  
• Lift slope ( a0) [1/rad ] – tip and root airfoils  
• Angle of attack for L = 0  (L=0) [deg] 
• Profile drag ( Cd_0) 
 
Flying (airflow) characteristics:  
• Air density ( ∞) 
• Airspeed  (V∞) 
• Air dynamic viscosity ( ∞) 
 
The LLT procedure  is described in the following steps:

With the previous information, the computational procedure can begin:  
 
Divide the wing into a  defined  number of spanwise stations. Here , k + 1 stations are shown, 
with n designating any specific station  
 
 
 
For k = 1, 2, 3,  .., N points, calculate the following : The N points along the span are chosen 
to be  equally spaced. In other words, the wingspan  is divided into N equal intervals, and each 
interval's midpoint is chosen as  a control point. The port (left) wing tip is located at y = -bw 
/2, whereas the starboard (right) wing tip is located at y = b w /2. 
 
The coordinates of the control points are then given as follows : for each value of k, from 1 
to N, we have:

The specification for aerodynamic twist  is quite complicated  since it requires knowledge of the shape 
of the airfoil section at each station y along the span. In the absence of such information, this problem 
can be somewhat by requiring that the tip airfoil  differs only slightly from the root airfoil  such that 
the following linear relationships give the lift coefficient and zero angle of attack at y

The geometric angle of attack (geo) may vary as a funct ion of y if the wing is given a geometric twist. 
A wing without twist is one where t he geo is constant for all values of y, such that the leading edge 
and the trailing edge of the wing are straight lines, which lie on the same horizontal pl ane when geo 
= 0. 
 
A wing may be given a wash -out, where the wing is twisted such that t he leading edge of the wing 
tip airfoil  is now lower than the leading edge of the root airfoil  (the root airfoil  is the airfoil  located 
at the plane of symmetry if it is imagined  that the fuselage is not there,  and the two halves of the wing 
meet at the plane of symmetry). A wing with wash -in is one where the leading edge of the tip airfoil  
is now high er than the root airfoil’s  leading edge, whereas the wing's trailing edge  rema ins on the 
horizontal plane. Therefore,  the airfoil  chord  at y may have negative or positive geometric angle of 
attack values when geo = 0 at the wing  root, depending on whether the wing has a wash -out or a 
wash -in. 
  
 
Let the height difference between the wing tip airfoil's leading edge and the root airfoil's leading edge  
be htip, which is negati ve for wash -out and positive for wash -in. 
 
 
 
It should be noted that the wing's leading edge must  remain in a straight line. Therefore, the twist 
angle or the geometric angle  of attack at y relative to the geometric angle of attack at the wing root 
can be calculated as follows :

Let´s now apply LLT to find the solution in the form of span -wise wing load or lift per unit span 
length distribution, the overall wing’s lift coefficient (C L_w), and the induced drag coefficient of the 
wing  (CDi_w). From the Kutta -Joukowski  Lift Theorem , it is known that lift is directly proportional to 
circulation or vortex strength. Therefore, the theory must be capable of predicting the span -wise 
bound vortex strength per unit length distribution. The unknown vortex strength distribution, (y), is 
approximated by a Fourier  series:

The fundamental  problem is calculating  the unknown Fourier  series coefficients or amplitudes, An. 
The Fourier series approximation  becomes more accurate as the number of terms, N, increases. The

This equation contains N unknowns, A(n)  for n = 1  to N. It is , therefore, necessary to apply the last 
equation at N different control points or values of distance along the span, y  so that we have a system 
of equations that can be solved simultaneously to calculate the values of A(n) . The points chosen 
should not include the wing tips  since , regardless of the values of the Fourier coefficients, the vortex 
strength distribution ( ( )) is always satisfied at those points. Selecting those 2 points will not 
provide any new information regarding the values of the Fourier amplitudes. It is also recommended 
that the midpoint ( y = 0 ) should not be selected as a control point  for similar reasons. The following 
method for selecting the control points is recommended to get the most accurate result for a given 
number of control points . First, N should be chosen as an even integer, such as N = 2M . 
 
The N points along the span are chosen to be  equally spaced. In other words, the span is divided into 
N equal intervals, and each interval's midpoint is chosen as  a control point. The port (left) wing tip is 
at y = -bw /2, whereas the starboard (right) wing tip is at y = b w /2. 
 
 
 
The equation ( ) can be rewritten in a way  which separates the even terms from the odd terms as 
follows:

It should be noted that c(k) is the airfoil’s  chord length at the station y(k), or  (k ), whereas geo and 
L = 0 (k) are the geometric and zero lift angle of attacks at y(k). The geometric angle of attack may 
vary as a function of y if the wing is given a geometric twist. A wing without a twist is one where the 
geometric angle of attack is constant for all values of y, such that the wing's leading edge and trailing 
edge are straight lines, which lie on the same horizontal plane when geo = 0. 
 
A wing may be given a wash -out, where the wing is twisted such that the leading edge of the wing 
tip airfoil  is no w lower than the leading edge of the root airfoil  (the root airfoil  is the airfoil  located 
at the plane of symmetry if it is imagined  that the fuselage is not there,  and the two halves of the wing 
meet at the plane of s ymmetry).  
 
A wing with wash -in is one where the leading edge of the tip airfoil  is now high er than the root 
airfoil’s  leading edge, whereas the wing's trailing edge  rema ins on the horizontal plane. Therefore,  
the airfoil  chord  at y may have negative or positive geometric angle of attack values when geo = 0 at 
the wing  root, depending on whether the wing has a wash -out or a wash -in. 
 
The height difference between the wing tip airfoil's leading edge and the root airfoil’s  leading edge  
is htip, which is negative for wash -out and positive for wash -in. It should be noted that the wing's 
leading edge must  remain in a straight line. Therefore, the twist angle or the geometric angle of attack 
at y relative to the geometric angle of attack at the wing root can be calculated as follows

The angle of attack of the wing or the aircraft is denoted by the angle of attack at the wing root  and 
is given the symbol of geo. This angle obviously can be varied and represents the aircraft's attitude  
(when the aircraft is at a level cruising flight this angle may have a small positive value of not more 
than 3 degrees). Using this definition,  it can now calculate the geometric angle of attack at y as follows

A wing may be given an aerodynamic twist and a geometric twist. This means that the airfoil  shape 
at the wing root is different from that at the wing tip. The shape of the airfoil  in between the two 
limiting stations is then determined by insisting that the wing cross -section should have a smoothly 
varying shape along the spanwise  direction. Since the airfoil  shape at the wing tip is different from 
that at the root, therefore the value of the sectional lift coefficient , as well as its zero -lift angle of 
attack, may also vary along the span -wise direction. Provided the variation of a0 (y) and L = 0 (y) are 
given, the equation of C (k, 2n -1) can still be used to compute the matrix coefficients. Thus,  the lifting 
line theory can handle such a problem.  
 
The theory can also handle the problem involving a variation in the chord length of the sections as a 
function of y if the functional form of c(y) is given. This means the theory is also applicable for 
analyzing  tapered wing shape, so long as the quarter chord line is normal or almost normal to the 
aircraft’s longitudinal axis. Obviously, the theory is not valid for a highly swept wing. A more 
elaborated methodology , like the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM),  should be used for swept wings .

  Example:  
 
For the acrobatic monoplane Extra EA -300, calculate (1) the aerodynamic characteristics of flight to 
see if the actual geometry can counteract the Maximum Take -Off Weight (MTOW) for an average  
cruise  condition with a wing  incidence angle  of 2 [deg ] and (2) find the distributed aerodynamic load 
(Lift force) over the wing. An airplane 3 -view picture is shown:  
 
 
 
Specifications:  
 
• MTOW = 950 [kg]  
• Wingspan  (bw) = 8 .0 [m] 
• Taper ratio ( w) = 0.45  
• Wing reference area (S w) = 10.7 [m2] 
• Airfoil  information:  
o Root – NACA 0015  
o Tip – NACA 0012  
 
Performance:  
 
• Vcruise = 317.0 [km/h]  
• Vstall = 102.0 [km/h]  
• VNE = 408.0 [km/h]  
 
Solution:  
 
 
First,  the geometric characteristics of the wing must be determined , beginning  with the LLT 
methodology.

Assuming sea -level conditions  (∞ = 1.225 [kg/m3]; ∞ = 1.789 x 10-5 [kg/(m sec)]) , and cruise flight 
conditions, then:

These curves were obtained through software that uses the Vortex Panel Method to give the

wing. These curves were analyzed  at a Reynolds number of 8 x106. From the curves,  the following

As this wing has an aerodynamic twist, it can be assumed there is no need for a geometric twist; 
therefore tip = 0.

First, the wing is divided in to two symmetrical section s, the left wing  (port side) and the right -wing  
(starboard side):  
 
 
 
Then , we can establish the number of control points (k) calculated for the wing. In this case, we will 
put eight control points, which means there will  be four per half-wing.  
 
 
 
Establishing  the above, the y -stations on the wingspan  (half in this case) can be found as follows:  
 
𝑦(𝑘)=−𝑏𝑤

Results are shown in the following table:

2 -2.5 
3 -1.5 
4 -0.5 
 
The local chord length values at each station (control point) are found by:  
 
𝑐(𝑘)=𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡(1−2𝜆−1

Results are shown in the following table:  
 
k c(k) [m]  
1 0.957  
2 1.211  
3 1.464  
4 1.718  
 
Next, the twist angle distribution is calculated using the relations:  
 
𝛽(𝑘)=𝑠𝑖𝑛−1(−2𝑦(𝑘)
𝑏𝑤⋅𝑐(𝑘)⋅ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑝);ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑝=𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽𝑡𝑖𝑝 
 
In this airplane , the wing has an aerodynamical twist instead of a geometric one therefor the results 
are: 
 
k  (k) [deg]  
1 0 
2 0 
3 0 
4 0 
 
The variation of the lift slope along the wing will vary because the root and tip airfoils  have different 
references. This also happens with the zero-lift angle of attack for the different points of control. The 
variations are calculated using:  
 𝑎0(𝑘)=𝑎0_𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡−2𝑎0_𝑡𝑖𝑝−𝑎0_𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡
𝑏𝑤𝑦(𝑘) 
𝛼𝐿=0(𝑘)=𝛼𝐿=0_𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡−2𝛼𝐿=0_𝑡𝑖𝑝−𝛼𝐿=0_𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡
𝑏𝑤𝑦(𝑘) 
 
The results are shown in the following table:  
 
k a0(k)  L=0(k) 
1 6.372  0 
2 6.390  0 
3 6.408  0 
4 6.427  0 
 
Note that for this wing, as booth airfoils  are symmetrical , the zero-lift angle of attack is equal to zero 
for both cases; therefore,  the variation will also have this same value along the span.  
 
Now, let’s calculate the transformation (k) using:  
 
𝜃(𝑘)=𝑐𝑜𝑠−1(−2𝑦
𝑏𝑤) 
 
The results  of this relation are shown as follows,  
 
k  (k) [deg] 
1 28.955  
2 51.318  
3 67.976  
4 82.819  
 
With these values  now, the D(k) variation can be calculated:  
 
𝐷(𝑘)=𝛼𝑔𝑒𝑜−𝛼𝐿=0(𝑘)+𝛽(𝑘) 
 
The results  for this equation are:  
 
k D(k) [rad] 
1 0.035  
2 0.035  
3 0.035  
4 0.035  
 
Next, we want to create the 4x4-sized  matrix coefficients with the following formula:  
 
𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)=[(4𝑏𝑤
𝑎0(𝑘)𝑐(𝑘)+2𝑛−1
𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃(𝑘)))𝑠𝑖𝑛((2𝑛−1)𝜃(𝑘))] 
 Where k = n = 4, this is because we are taking advantage of the symmetry of the wing loading 
distribution,  we have N = 4 , and we can use n =  1, 2, 3 , and 4 (port wing only) or n = 5, 6, 7  and 8 
(starboard wing only). We can calculate each point's variation if only port wing control points are 
chosen . For this example, we present only 4 points as references :

𝐶(1,1)=[(4(8.0)

Results for this equation are given in the following matrix:

 The next  step in the LLT methodology is to solve the following system of simultaneous equations:  
 
∑𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)𝐴(𝑛)=𝐷(𝑘)𝑁
𝑛=1 , for k = 1, 2, 3, …, N  
 
For this case , the equation system gives:

The Gaussian elimination method can solve this equation system . Other methods, such as the Jacobi 
or Gauss -Seidel iterative methods , may also be used.  
 
The solution of an equation system (matrices) by the Gaussian Elimination is:  
 
𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)𝐴(𝑛)=𝐷(𝑘)⇒𝐴(𝑛)=[𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)]−1⋅𝐷(𝑘) 
 
This means  that the inverse of the matrix C(k,n) must be found  first, to solve the system, this is done 
in this case by the Gauss -Jordan method:  
 
[𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)]−1=(3.54111.4288.984 −7.6
4.2293.504−10.254−0.177

With the matrix inverse result, the system can be solve for A(n) by multiplying [C(k,n)]-1 by D(k):  
 
𝐴(𝑛)=[𝐶(𝑘,𝑛)]−1⋅𝐷(𝑘)=(𝐴(1)

With these results, the wing lift coefficient can now be found by the relation:  
 𝐶𝐿_𝑤=𝜋⋅𝐴𝑅⋅𝐴(1)=𝜋⋅(5.98)⋅(0.008734)=0.164 
 
The total lift force exerted by the wing is:  
 
𝐿𝑤=𝑞∞𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐿_𝑤=1
2𝜌∞𝑉∞2𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐿_𝑤=1
2(1.225)(88.056)2(10.7)(0.164)=8340.38[𝑁] 
 
𝐿𝑤=8340.38[𝑁]=850.192[𝑘𝑔] 
 
Analyzing  this result and comparing it with the opposing force (airplane´s MTOW) , the geometric 
angle of attack of two degrees is not enough to lift off  the aircraft  from the ground; L w < MTOW.  
 
This means the airplane still needs more lift force to counteract the MTOW for a geometric angle of 
attack (incidence angle) of two degrees . Some considerations must be made to ensure the wing, with 
its geometric and aerodynamic characteristics, can achieve enough lift force; then, different incidence 
angles must be studied  to study the possibilities of wing attitude with respect to the horizontal plane 
of the aircraft.  
 
The following figure illustrates the differences between the geometric (incidence) angle of attack, the 
effective angle of attack , and the induced angle of attack:  
 
 
 
Examining the profile drag curves of both airfoils , it is decided that the wing's total profile drag 
coefficient is c d_0 = 0.0054 for a geometric angle of two degrees.  
 
Now, let´s calculate the total wing drag force at the established conditions:  
 
The Oswald efficiency planform factor is crucial for calculating the wing -induced  drag under the 
given flight conditions . The equation to find it is:  
 
( )11e−+= 
, where: 𝛿=∑𝑛(𝐴(𝑛)
𝐴(1))2𝑁
𝑛=2  
 
The delta coefficient depends on the Fourier series coefficients, which were calculated previously.  
 
𝛿=∑𝑛(𝐴(𝑛)
𝐴(1))2 𝑁
𝑛=2=2⋅(0.000133
0.008734)2
+3⋅(0.000244
0.008734)2
+4⋅(−0.000034
0.008734)2
=0.002876  
 
𝑒=(1+𝛿)−1=(1+0.002876)−1=0.9971  
 
As a result, it shows a high value, so it should be checked with another methodology that predicts 
wing efficiency.  
 
The induced drag coefficient C Di is obtained by:  
 
𝐶𝐷𝑖=𝐶𝐿2
𝜋⋅𝑒⋅𝐴𝑅=𝑘⋅𝐶𝐿2, where: 𝑘=1
𝜋⋅𝑒⋅𝐴𝑅=1
𝜋(0.9971)(5.98)=0.0534  
 
𝐶𝐷𝑖=𝐶𝐿2
𝜋⋅𝑒⋅𝐴𝑅=𝑘⋅𝐶𝐿2=(0.0534)(0.164)2=0.00144  
 
The total wing drag coefficient will be:  
 
𝐶𝐷_𝑤=𝑐𝑑_𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓+𝐶𝐷𝑖=𝑐𝑑_𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓+𝐶𝐿2
𝜋⋅𝑒⋅𝐴𝑅=0.00684  
 
So, for this flight condition , the total wing drag will be equal to:  
 
𝐷𝑤=𝑞∞𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐷_𝑤=1
2𝜌∞𝑉∞2𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐷_𝑤=1
2(1.225)(88.056)2(10.7)0.00684=347.466[𝑁] 
 
𝐷𝑤=347.466[𝑁]=35.42[𝑘𝑔] 
 
 
Analyzing  the wing load distribution:  
 
The main idea of this analysis is to establish how the lift load distribution over the wing will be. For 
this, a distribution that describes an elliptical shape is expected to be obtained to make it as 
aerodynamically efficient as possible. First , define the stations where you want to study the local lift 
load; this helps you with already established stations . In this case , we are analyzing  half span 
beginning at the root of the wing:  
 
 
Station y(k)  Points of control + c tip and c root – y Location [m]  
y(0) = b w /2 0 4.0 
y(1) 1 3.5 
y(2) 2 2.5 
y(3) 3 1.5 
y(4) 4 0.5 
y(5) 5 0 
 
Recalling the transformation (k) using:  
 
𝜃(𝑘)=𝑐𝑜𝑠−1(−2𝑦
𝑏𝑤) 
  
 
 
This time , the results include the values at the root and the tip of the wing,

3 1.5 67.976  
4 0.5 82.819  
5 0 90.0 
 
Keeping in mind that the load distribution is symmetrical then , the equation can calculate circulation 
on each station over the wing : 
 
𝛤(𝑦)=𝛤(𝜃(𝑦))=2𝑏𝑤𝑉∞[𝐴(1)𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃(𝑦)+(𝐴(2))𝑠𝑖𝑛(3⋅𝜃(𝑦))] 
 
Results are presented in the following table :

5 0 12.306  
 
Non-dimensionalizing  the circulation is obtained ( 0 – circulation at the root of the wing) :

Now, let´s compute  the wing lift coefficient and the force in each station of the half -span. The 
equations can calculate the local wing lift coefficient and the correspondent force :

In addition, the lift distribution is plotted along the half wingspan to get the values of the distributed 
load over the wing:  
 
 
 
As established before, the net lift produced by this wing is not enough to counteract the MTOW. 
Further studies  should be done to ensure  proper values of the wing incidence angle of attack.  
 
Using the LLT mathematical model , we can find different values of the net wing lift coefficient at 
different angles of attack. The following graphs show the results of this procedure:

A new net wing lift coefficient value can be found with all this information . We must first be clear 
that in normal cruise flight at constant acceleration , the MTOW of the airplane is equal to the total 
net lift produced by the wing:  
 
𝐿𝑤=𝑀𝑇𝑂𝑊=1
2𝜌∞𝑉∞2𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐿_𝑤=𝑞∞𝑆𝑤𝐶𝐿_𝑤 
 
From this relation , the net wing lift coefficient is obtained:  
 
𝐶𝐿_𝑤=𝑀𝑇𝑂𝑊
𝑞∞𝑆𝑤=0.1834  
 
From the graph C L_w vs.  [deg] , the wing lift slope is calculated:  
 
𝑎=𝐶𝐿_𝑤
𝛼−𝛼𝐿=0=0.08213[1𝑑𝑒𝑔⁄]=4.715[1𝑟𝑎𝑑⁄] 
 
With this same relation, the net wing lift coefficient is calculated. It is to note that in this graph (CL_w 
vs.  [deg]) , it can be seen that L=0 = 0 for this particular wing, then  
 
𝐶𝐿_𝑤=𝑎(𝛼−𝛼𝐿=0)=𝐶𝐿_𝑤=𝑎⋅𝛼 
 
Equating the last relation,  the angle of attack required for the cruise condition is found to be:  
 
𝛼=𝐶𝐿_𝑤
𝑎=0.1834
0.08213≈2.24[𝑑𝑒𝑔] 
 
With this new value of the geometric (wing incidence) angle of attack, the values of the wing 
aerodynamic characteristics are:  
 
Wing Aerodynamic Characteristic  Value  Units  
Lift force  (Lw) 952.2 2 kgf 
Induced drag coefficient  (CD_i) 0.0018  - 
Total drag force  (Dw) 37.32 kgf 
 
You could study more about the response to changes in variables like altitude (height), velocity, 
different airfoils, the application of a geometric twist angle, and even the change in the geometric 
shape of the wing to check the consequences for  the aerodynamic characteristics of this airplane wing.
