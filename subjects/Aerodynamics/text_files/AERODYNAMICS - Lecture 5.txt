UPBFLOW SEPARATIONWHY DOES AN AIRFOIL STALL?
•Key to understanding: Friction causes flow separation within the boundary layer (B.L.).
1.B.L. either laminar or turbulent.
2.All laminar B.L. → turbulent B.L.
3.Turbulent B.L. is “fuller” than laminar B.L., more resistant to separation.
•Separation creates another form of drag called pressure drag due to separation.
•Dramatic loss of lift and increase in drag.
OVERVIEW: AIRFOIL STALL•Two significant consequences
ofseparated flow over the
airfoil .
•Dramatic loss oflift(stalling) .
•Separated flow causes higher
pressure ontheupper surface of
theairfoil .
•Major increase indrag .
•Separation causes lower pressure
onthetrailing edge .
•Unbalance of pressure force
causes pressure drag due to
separation .

DOES LIFT

BEND 
OVER?
•Adverse pressure gradient interacting with 
velocity profile through B.L.
•High -speed flow near the upper edge of B.L. 
has enough speed to keep moving through 
an adverse pressure gradient.
•Lower speed fluid (which has been retarded 
by friction) is exposed to the same adverse 
pressure gradient and is stopped, and the 
direction of flow can be reversed.
•This reversal of flow direction causes the 
flow to separate.
•Turbulent B.L. has more resistance to flow 
separation than laminar B.L. because of a 
fuller velocity profile.
•To help prevent flow separation, we desire a 
turbulent B.L.
WHY DOES BOUNDARY LAYER 
SEPARATE•Key tounderstanding
•Friction causes flow separation within theboundary layer .
•Separation then creates another form ofdrag called pressure drag due
toseparation .
WHY DOES AN AIRFOIL STALL?10
•Both NACA 4412 and NACA 4421 have the
same shape ofthemean camber line.
•Thin Airfoil Theory predicts that linear liftslope
andaL=0should bethesame forboth .
•Leading edge stall shows arapid drop oflift
curve near maximum lift.
•Trailing edge stall shows gradual bending -over
ofliftcurve atmaximum lift,“soft stall” .
•High cl,max forairfoils with leading -edge stall.
•Flat plate stall exhibits the poorest behavior ;
early stalling .
•Thickness hassignificant effect oncl,max.NACA 4412 VERSUS NACA 442111•NACA 4421 (21% thickness)
•Progressive and gradual 
movement of separation 
from the trailing edge 
toward the leading edge 
as ais increased.
•Called Trailing Edge Stall.
EXAMPLE OF TRAILING 
EDGE STALL12
•Example :Flat Plate with 2%thickness
(like aNACA 0002 ).
•Flow separates offthe leading edge
even atlowa(a~3deg).
•Initially, small regions ofseparated
flow called separation bubble .
•Asanincreased reattachment point

separation .THIN AIRFOIL STALL13•NACA 4412 Airfoil (12%thickness)
•Linear increase incluntil thestall.
•Atajust below 15ºstreamlines arehighly curved
(large lift)and stillattached totheairfoil’s upper
surface .
•Atajust above 15ºmassive flow -field separation
occurs over top surface ofairfoil →significant
loss oflift.
•Called Leading Edge Stall .
•Characteristic ofrelatively thin airfoils with
thickness between about 10and 16percent

The goal ofanairfoil design varies depending onthemission that issetfor,as
anexample :
•Some airfoils aredesigned toproduce lowDand may notberequired togenerate L

•Some sections may need toproduce lowDwhile producing agiven amount ofL.

The design problem starts when one hassomehow defined anobjective for

•Byhand ,using knowledge ofthe effects ofgeometry changes onCpand Cpchanges onperformance .
•Bynumerical optimization ,using shape functions torepresent the airfoil

CHARACTERISTICS1. Airfoil design methods –Design byauthority (historical)
Use anairfoil already designed bysomeone who knew what heorshe was doing .This "design byauthority"
works well when the goals ofaparticular design problem happen tocoincide with the goals ofthe original
airfoil design .The advantage ofthis method isthat there istest data available, therefore nounlikely surprises,
forexample, unexpected early stall.
Airfoils may bechosen from catalogs :
•Abbott andDoenhoff's Theory ofWing Sections
•Althaus' andWortmann's Stuttgarter Profilkatalog

This involves specifying asection geometry and calculating pressures and
performance .With this evaluation, anairfoil isselected, agiven shape is
determined, and then itismodified toimprove itsperformance .
The two main sub-problems inthis type ofmethod are:
1. The identification ofthemeasure ofperformance .
2. The approach tochanging theshape sothat theperformance isimproved .AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS2.Airfoil design methods –Direct
•Start with anassumed airfoil shape, then you must determine the characteristic of
this section that affects the mission performance tofixthis problem subsequently .
This process offixing themost obvious problems with agiven airfoil isrepeated until
there isnomajor problem with theaerodynamic section .
•The design ofsuch airfoils does notrequire aspecific definition ofascalar objective
function .Still, itdoes require some expertise toidentify thepotential problems and
often considerable expertise tofixthem .

Result :thepressure peak atlowcliseasily removed .The

much totheupper surface pressure peak, and

CHARACTERISTICS3.Airfoil design methods –Inverse design
•The objective istotarget theCpdistribution .
•Itissometimes possible tospecify adesired Cpdistribution and usetheleast
squares difference between theactual and target Cp'sastheobjective .
•This isthe basic idea behind various methods for inverse design .For
example, thin airfoil theory (TAT)can beused tosolve fortheshape ofthe
camber line that produces aspecified pressure difference onanairfoil in
potential flow .AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –problems :Thick airfoils
•The difficulty with thick airfoils isthat theminimum pressure is
decreased due tothickness .This results inamore severe
adverse pressure gradient and theneed tostart recovery sooner .
•Ifthemaximum thickness point isspecified, thesection with the
maximum thickness must recover from agiven point with the
steepest possible gradient .Liebeck addressed this problem in
connection with Lmax.
•The thickest possible section has aboundary layer just onthe
verge ofseparation throughout therecovery .
•The thickest section atRe=10million is57%thick, but of
course, itwillseparate suddenly with anyAoA.
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –problems :High -liftairfoils
•ForLmax,the best recovery location ischosen, and the airfoil is
made very thin sothat the lower surface produces Lmax.(Since
the upper surface Cpisspecified, increasing thickness only
reduces thelower surface pressures) .
•Ifthe upper surface Cpismore negative than -3.0,the
perturbation velocity isgreater than thefreestream, meaning the
lower surface flow isupstream forathin section .This would
cause separation, and themaximum liftisachieved with anupper
surface velocity ofjust over 2Uand abitofthickness tokeep the
lower surface near stagnation pressure .
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –problems :Low Reairfoils
•Make theairfoil design problem difficult because theboundary
layer ismuch less capable ofhandling anadverse pressure
gradient without separation .Thus, very lowRedesigns donot
have severe pressure gradients, and the maximum lift
capability isrestricted .
•These airfoils are “cursed” with too much laminar flow .Itis
sometimes challenging toensure the boundary layer is
turbulent over thesteepest pressure recovery regions .Laminar
separation bubbles are common and, unless adequately
stabilized, canlead toexcessive Dand lowLmax.
•Most oftheboundary layer islaminar .Under such conditions,
theboundary layer can handle only gradual pressure recovery .
Based ontheexpressions forlaminar separation, anall-laminar
section cangenerate aclofabout 0.4orachieve athickness of
about 7.5%.
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –problems :Low -moment airfoils
•When theairfoil pitching moment isconstrained, carrying liftasfar
back ontheairfoil asdesired isnot always possible .Such situations
arise inthe design ofsections fortailless aircraft, helicopter rotor
blades, and even sails, kites, etc.
•The example airfoil isaLiebeck section designed toperform well at
low Rewith apositive cm,0.Itsperformance isnot bad, but itis
inferior incl_max compared toother sections without acmconstraint .
(cl_max=1.35vs.1.60forconventional sections atRe=500000 ).
•The thickest section atRe=10million is57%thick, butofcourse, it
willseparate suddenly with anyangle ofattack .
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –Laminar airfoils
•Good forreducing skin friction drag and increasing Lmax.
•This may beachieved without toomuch work atlowRebymaintaining asmooth surface and using
anairfoil with afavorable pressure gradient .
•The pressure recovery helps achieve the maximum run offavorable gradient oneither upper or
lower surfaces .
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –Supercritical airfoils
•Usually refers toaparticular type ofairfoil designed tooperate efficiently
with substantial regions ofsupersonic flow .
AIRFOIL USAGE 
CHARACTERISTICS•Airfoil design –Supercritical airfoils
•This sections often take advantage ofmany ofthefollowing design ideas tomaximize Lort/cat
agiven M∞:
• Carry asmuch liftasispractical ontheaftportion ofthesection where theflow issubsonic .The aftlower surface isanobvious candidate forincreased
loading (more positive Cp).
• Ensure that sufficient Liscarried ontheforward portion oftheupper surface .AstheM∞increases, thepressure peak near thenose diminishes, and
without additional blunting ofthenose, anextra liftmay belost inthis region .
• The lower surface near thenose canalso beloaded byreducing thelower surface thickness near theleading edge .This provides both Land apositive
pitching moment .
• Shocks ontheupper surface near theL.E.produce much less wave drag than shocks aftoftheairfoil crest, and itisfeasible, although notalways best,
todesign sections with forward shocks .Such sections areknown as"peaky" airfoils and were used onmany transport aircraft .
• The idea ofcarefully tailoring thesection toobtain locally supersonic flow without shockwaves (shock -free sections) hasbeen pursued formany years,
and such sections have been designed and tested .Formost practical cases with arange ofdesign CLand Mach numbers, sections with weak shocks are
favored .AIRFOIL USAGE
