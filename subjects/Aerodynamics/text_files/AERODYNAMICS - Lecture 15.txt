UPBStatic stability deals withtheinitial tendency ofavehicle toreturn toequilibrium ortodiverge
from itafter being disturbed .
Itsaysnothing about whether iteverreaches itsequilibrium position orhowitgetsthere, such
matters aretherealm ofdynamic stability .
There arethree types ofstatic stability :
•Statically stable
•Statically unstable
•Neutrally stableNOTIONS OF AIRCRAFT STABILITY
STATIC STABILITYStatically stable :
Iftheforces andmoments onthebody caused byadisturbance tend
initially toreturn thebody toward itsequilibrium position, thebody is
statically stable .Thebody haspositive static stability .
Statically unstable :
Iftheforces andmoments aresuch thatthebody continues tomove
away from itsequilibrium position after being disturbed, thebody is
statically unstable .Thebody hasnegative static stability .
Neutrally stable :
Ifthemoments onthebody arezeroandcontinue themovement of
thedisturbance after losing itsinitial equilibrium condition .This
situation israreinflight vehicles .NOTIONS OF AIRCRAFT STABILITY
STATIC STABILITY
Dynamic stability deals withthetime history ofthevehicle’s motion
after initially responding toitsstatic stability .
Dynamic stable :abody isdynamically stable if,outofitsownaccord,
iteventually returns toandremains atitsequilibrium position over a
period oftime.Theoscillations decrease withtime.
Dynamically unstable :theequilibrium position isnever maintained for
anyperiod oftime, andtheaircraft eventually diverges completely .The
amplitude oftheoscillations increases withtime.
Dynamically neutral :theaircraft willpitch back and forth with
constant amplitude oscillations .Theamplitude oftheoscillations does
notdecrease withtime.NOTIONS OF AIRCRAFT 
STABILITY
DYNAMIC STABILITY
The conventional control surfaces on a typical aircraft are:
•Elevators (Canards)
•Ailerons
•Rudder
Their functions are usually:
1.To change the aircraft from one equilibrium position to another
2.To produce non -equilibrium accelerated motions such as maneuvers
The study of the deflections of the ailerons, elevators, and rudder necessary to make the 
aircraft do what the pilot wants and the amount of force that he must exert (or the hydraulic 
boost system) to deflect these controls is part of a discipline called aircraft control.NOTIONS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROLPressure andshear stress distributions overawing produce apitching moment thatcanbetaken about
anarbitrary point (theleading edge, thetrailing edge, thequarter chord, etc.)
There isaparticular point about which themoments areindependent oftheangle ofattack .
This point isdefined astheaerodynamic center (a.c.)forthewing .
Themoment anditscoefficient about thea.c.aredenoted byMacand CM,acrespectively, where,

reason, issometimes called thezero-liftmoment .

Therefore, because the aircraft always
tends todiverge from equilibrium when

Thelastmoment equation results canbemodified foramoment contribution ofthefuselage .
Thisfuselage experiences amoment about itsa.c.,plussome liftanddragduetotheairflow around it.
Considering awing-body combination, theairflow willdiffer from thatover thewing andbody separately ;
aerodynamic interference occurs where theflowoverthewing affects thefuselage flow, andvice-versa .
Duetothisinterference, themoment duetothewing-body combination isnotsimply thesumoftheseparate
wing andfuselage moments .
Similarly, theliftanddrag ofthewing-body combination areaffected byaerodynamic interference, which is
difficult topredict theoretically .
Consequently, thelift,drag, andmoments ofawing -body combination areusually obtained from
wind tunnel measurements .CONTRIBUTION OF THE
