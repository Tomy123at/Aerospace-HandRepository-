UPB•Increase aerofoil camber
•Boundary layer control by:
–Improve pressure distribution
–Feed high-energy airflow to the boundary layer
–Remove of “old” boundary layer
•Increase of aerofoil/wing areaHIGH LIFT DEVICES•Working science
–Aerofoil camber is effectively increased. The more camber an 
aerofoil shape has at a given AoA, the higher the cl
d-flap deflection angle V∞
V∞a = 0
a > 0HIGH LIFT DEVICES•Working science
–When the flap is deflected a new chord line is appears 
(virtual chord line), rotated clockwise relative to the 
actual chord line of the aerofoil, with the result of a 
“virtual” increase of AoA, hence, clis increased

TRAILING EDGE•Slotted flap:
–When deflected create a slot 
between the aerofoil T.E. and the 
flap.
–Air can flow from the bottom to 
the top of the aerofoil through the 
specially shaped slot. This high-
energy flow produces a new 
boundary layer on the top surface 
of the flap, which allows flap 
angles of up to 40°without 
separating the flow, consequently 
max. lift is increased and drag is 
reduced by the slot

TRAILING EDGE•Fowler flap (FF)
–Have a slot between the aerofoil and the 
flap (slotted flap)
–First extended to the rear (linearly), thus 
increasing S
–By moving the FF downwards, the lift  is 
increased without a disproportionate 
increase in drag ( T.O.) 
–If FF is further extended, the flap body is 
also turned downwards, which now 
increase the aerofoil camber. The L
continues to increase, increasing also D
(Lnd)

LEADING EDGE•Leading Edge Slot
•Fixed slat placed in front of the aerofoil L.E.
•High energy flow is exerted on the top surface
•Although this is not to facilitate a bigger camber, but rather to utilize a 
higher AoAfor the existing aerofoil camber

SUMMARYHIGH LIFT DEVICES –
EXAMPLE•Active High lift devices –boundary layer control
–The idea is to either remove the low-energy segment of the boundary layer and let it be 
replaced by high-energy flow from above or by adding kinetic energy to the boundary layer 
directly
–Both of thesemethods maintain a laminar flow for a longer distance over the airfoil, delay 
separation, and allow one to get a larger angle of attack before stall occurs

SPECIAL CASES•Active High lift devices –Circulation control
–One of the most important potential applications of Coandaeffect
–The objective is to replace the aerofoil L.E. and T.E. high-lift devices for Coandasurfaces 
and slot blowing

SPECIAL CASES•Vortex generators (VG´s)
–Create stream-wise vortices close to the surface
–Mixing between boundary layer and free stream is increased due to 
the formation of vortices which bring momentum to the near wall 
region
–Hence near the wall flow become energies to withstand more adverse 
pressure gradient and flow separation become delay
–The conventional van-type VG has a height of the order of the 
boundary layer thickness, and has a penalty of drag increase (wake 
drag)

SUMMARY•Extra lift force changing the camber line geometry, new virtual AoAwhich changes the 
airflow and pressure distribution
•TAT can be applied to get an approximated value of the lift coefficient increment ( Dcl)
•TAT for symmetrical and cambered aerofoils with a flapped surface can only be 
applied to the plain type which are the most used for GA aircraft in the control 
surfaces (ailerons, elevators and rudder) and often for HLD
d-flap deflection angle TAT APPLICATION FOR 
FALPPED AEROFOILS•The distribution of the circulation along the camber line is the expressed as the sum 
of a flat plate at some incidence plus a camber line aerofoil and a flapped one
•Subdivisions of lift contributions to the total lift of a cambered flapped aerofoil
