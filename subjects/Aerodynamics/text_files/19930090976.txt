SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 
/, By IRA H. ABBOTT, ALBERT E. VON DOENHOFF, and LOUIS S. STIVERS, JR. 
SUMMARY 
Recent airfoil data for both flight and 'wind~tunnel tests have 
been collected and correlated insojar as possible. The flight 
data consist largely of drag measurements made' by the wake~ 
survey method. Most of~he data on airjoil section characteris~ 
tics were obtained in the Langley two-dimensionallow~turbulence 
pressure tunnel. Detail data necessary for the application of 
NAOA 6~series airfoils to wing design are presented in sup­
plementary figures, together with recent datajor the NAOA 00-, 
14-, 24-, 44-, and 230-series airjoils. The general methods 
used to derive the basic thickness jorms jor NAOA 6-and 
7 -series airjoils and the'ir corresponding pressure distributions 
are presented. Data and methods are given jor rapidly obtain­
ing the approximate pressure distributions jor N AOA four­
digit, five-digit, 6-, and 7-series airfoils. 
The report includes an analysis oj the lift, drag, pitching­
moment, and critical-speed characteristics of the airfoils, to­
gether with a discussion of the effects of surface conditions. 
Data on high-lift devices are presented. Problems associated 
with lateral-control devices, leading-edge air intakes, and inter­
ference are briefly discussed. The data indicate that the effects 
oj surface condition on the l~ft and drag characteristics are at 
least as large as the effects of the airfoil sha,pe and must be 
considered in airfoil selection and the prediction of wing charac­
teristics. Airjoils permUting extensive laminar flow, such as 
the NAOA 6-series airfoils, have much lower drag coefficients 
at high speed and cru~~sing lift coefficients than earlier types of 
airfoils if, and only if, the wing surfaces are suffic1~ently smooth 
and fair. The NAOA 6-scries airfoils also ha,1'e favorable 
crit?:cal-speed character'istics and do not appear to present 
1Lnu8ual problems associated with the applicat1:on oj high-l'i:ft 
and lateral-control devices. 
INTRODUCTION 
A considerable amount of airfoil data has been accumulated 
from tests in the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence 
tunnels. Data ha,ve also been obtained from tests both in 
other wind tunnels and in flight and include the effects of 
high-lift devices, surface irregularities, and interference. 
Some data are also available on the effects of ai.rfoil section 
on aileron characteristics. Although a large amount of these 
data has been published, the scattered nature of the data 
and the limited objectives of the reports have prevented 
adequate analysis and interpretation of the results. The 
purpose of this report is to summarize these data and to 
correlate and interpret t,hem insofar as possible. Recent information on the aerodynamic characteristics of 
NACA airfoils is presented. The historical development of 
NACA airfoils is briefly reviewed. New data are presented 
that permit the rapid calculation of the approximate pressure 
distributions for the older NACA four-digit and five-digit 
airfoils by the same methods used for the N ACA 6-series 
airfoils. The general methods used to derive the basic thick­
ness forms for N ACA 6-and 7 -series airfoils together with 
their corresponding pressure distributions are presented. 
Detail data necessary for the application of the airfoils to 
wing design are presented in supplementary figures placed at 
the end of the paper. The report includes an analysis of 
the lift, drag, pitching~moment, and critical-speed charac:' 
teristics of the airfoils, together with a discussion of the 
effects of surface conditions. Available data on high-lift 
devices are presented. Problems associated with lateral­
control devices, leading-edge air intakes, and interference 
are briefly discussed, together with aerodynamic. problems 
of application. 
Numbered figures are used to illustrate the text and to 
present miscellaneous data. Supplementary figures and 
tables are not numbered but are conveniently arranged at 
the end of the report according to the numerical designation 
of the airfoil section within the following headings:

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 
The development of types of NACA airfoils now in com­
mon use was started in 1929 with a systematic investigation 
of a family of airfoils in the Langley variable-density tunnel. 
Airfoils of this family were designated by numbers having 
four digits, such as the NACA 4412 airfoil. All airfoils of 
this family had the same basic thickness distribution (refer­
ence 1), and the amount and type of camber was systemati­
cally varied to produce the family of related airfoils. This 
investigation of the NACA airfoils of the four-digit series 
produced airfoil sections having higher maximum lift 
coefficients and lower minimum drag coefficients than those 
of sections developed before that time. The investigation 
also provided information on the changes in aerodynamic 
characteristics resulting from variations of geometry of the 
mean line and thickness ratio (reference 1). SUMMARY OF AIRFOIJ" DATA 3 
The investigation was extended in references 2 and 3 to 
include airfoils with the same thickness distribution but 
with positions of the maximum camber far forward on the 
airfoil. These airfoils were designated by numbers having 
five digits, such as the NACA 23012 airfoil. Some airfoils 
of this family showed favorable aerodynamic characteristics 
except for a large sudden loss in lift at the stall. 
. Although these investigations were extended to include a 
limited number of airfoils with varied thickness distribu­
tions (references 1 and 3 to 6), no extensive investigations of 
thickness distribution were made. Comparison of experi­
mental drag data at low lift coefficients with the, skin­
friction coefficients for flat plates indicated that nearly all 
of the profile drag under such conditions was attributable 
to skin friction. It was therefore apparent that any pro­
nounced reduction of the profile drag must be obtained by a 
reduction of the skin friction through increasing the relative 
extent of the laminar boundary layer. 
Decreasing pressures in the direction of flow and low air­
stream turbulence were known to be favorable for laminar 
flow. An attempt was accordingly made to increase the 
relative extent of laminar flow by the development of air­
foils having favorable pressure gradients over a greater 
proportion of the chord than the airfoils developed in refer­
ences 1, 2, 3, and 6. The actual attainment of extensive 
laminar boundary layers at large Reynolds numbers was a 
previously unsolved experimental problem requiring the 
development of new t.est equipment with very low air­
stream turbulence. This work was greatly encouraged by 
the experiments of Jones (reference 7), who demons~rated 
the possibility of obtaining extensive laminar layers in flight 
at relatively large Reynolds numbers. Uncert.ainty with 
regard to factors affecting separation of the turbulent 
boundary layer required experiments to determine the 
possibility of making the rather sharp pressure recoveries 
required over the rear portion of the new type of airfoil. 
New wind tunnels were designed specifically for testing 
airfoils under conditions closely approaching flight condi­
tions of air-stream turbulence and Reynolds number. The 
resulting wind tunnels, the Langley two-dimensional low­
turbulence tunnel (LTT) and the Langley two-dimensional 
low-turbulence pressure tunnel (TDT), and the methods 
used for obtaining and correcting data are briefly described 
in the appendix. In these tunnels the models completely 
span the comparatively narrow test sections; two­
dimensional flow is thus provided, which obviates difficulties 
previously encountered in obtaining section data from 
tests of finite-span wings and in correcting adequately for 
support interference (reference 8). 
Difficulty was encountered in attempting to design air­
foils having desired pressure distributions because of the lack 
of adeql.late theory. The Theodorsen method (reference 9), 
as ordinarily used for calculating the pressure distributions 
about airfoils, was not sufficiently accurate near the leading 
edge for prediction of the local pressure gradients. In the 
absence of a suitable theoretical method, the 9-percent­
thick symmetrical airfoil of the N ACA 16-series (reference 10) was obtained by empirical modification of the previously 
used thickness distributions (reference 4). These NACA 
16-series sections represented the first family of the low-drag 
high-critical-speed sections. 
Successive attempts to design airfoils by approximate 
theoretical methods led to families of airfoils designated 
N ACA 2-to 5-series sections (reference 11). Experience with 
these sections showed that none of the approximate methods 
tried was sufficien tly accurate to show correctly the effect 
of changes in profile near the leading edge. Wind-tunnel 
and flight tests of these airfoils showed that extensive laminar 
boundary layers could be maintained at cOplparatively large 
values of the Reynolds number if the airfoil surfaces were 
sufficiently fair and smooth. These tests also provided 
qualitative information on the effects of the magnitude of 
the favorable pressure gradient, leading-edge radius, and other 
shape variables. The data also showed that separation of 
the turbulent boundary layer over the rear of the section, 
especially with rough surfaces, limited the extent of laminar 
layer for which the airfoils should be designed. The air­
foils of these early families generally showed relatively low 
maximum lift coefficients and, in many cases, were designed 
for a greater extent of laminar flow than is practical. It was 
learned that, although sections designed for an excessive 
extent of laminar flow gave extremely low drag coefficients 
near the designJift coefficient when sm09th, the drag of such 
sections became unduly large when rough, particularly at lift 
coefficients higher than the design lift. These families of 
airfoils are accordingly considered obsolete. 
The NACA 6-series basic thickness forms were derived by 
new and improved methods described herein in the section 
"Methods of Derivation of Thick.9.ess Distributions," in ac­
cordance with design criterions established with the objective 
of obtaining desirable drag, critical Mach number, and 
maximum-lift characteristics. The present-report deals largely 
with the characteristics of these sections. The develop­
ment of the NACA 7-series family has also been started. 
This family of airfoils is characterized by a greater extent of 
laminar flow on the lower than on the upper surface. These 
slilctions permit low pitching-moment coefficients with mod­
erately high design lift coefficients at the expense of some 
reduction in maximum lift and critical Mach number.

DESCRIPTION OF AIRFOILS 
METHOD OF COMBINING MEAN LINES AND THICKNESS DISTRIBUTIONS 
The cambered airfoil sections of all N ACA families con­
sidered herein are obtained by combining a mean line and a 
thickness distribution. The, necessary geometric data and 
some theoretical aerodynamic data for the mean lines and 
thickness distributions may be obtained from the supple­
mentary figures by the methods described for each family of 
airfoils. 4 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAU'fICS

FIGURE I.-Method of combining mean lines and basic thickness forms. 
The process for combining a mean line and a thickness. 
distribution to obtain the desired cambered airfoil section is 
illustrated in figure 1. The leading and trailing edges are 
defined as the forward and rearward extremities, respectively, 
of the mean line. The chord line is defined as the straight 
line connecting the leading and trailing edges. Ordinates of 
the cambered airfoil are obtained by laying off the thickness 
distribution perpendicular to the mean line. The abscissas, 
ordinates, and slopes of the mean line are designated as Xc, 
Yc, and tan (J, respectively. If Xu and Yu represent, respec­
tively, the abscissa and ordinate of a typical point of the 
upper surface of the airfoil and Y t is the ordinate of the 
symmetrical thickness distribution at chordwise position X, 
the upper-surface coordinates are given by the following 
relations: 
xu=X-Yt sin (J (1) 
(2) 
The corresponding expressions for the lower-surface coordi­
nates are 
(3) 
(4) 
The center for the leading-edge radius is found by drawing 
a line through the end of the chord at the leading edge with 
the slope equal to the slope of the mean line at that point 
and laying off a distance from the leading edge along this line 
equal to the leading-edge radius. This method of construc­
tion causes the cambered a.irfoils to p.roject slightly forward of the leading-edge point. Because the slope at the leading 
edge is theoretically infinite for the mean lines having a 
theoretically finite load at the leading edge, the slope of the 
radius through the end of the chord for such mean lines is 
usually taken as the slope of the mean line at ~=0.005. This c 
procedure is justified by the manner in which the slope 
increases to the theoretically infinite value as x/c approaches 
o. The slope increases slowly until very small values of x/c 
are reached. Large values of the slope are thus limited to 
values of x/c very close to 0 and may be neglected in practical 
airfoil design. 
Tables of ordinates are included in the supplementary data 
for all airfoils for which standard characteristics are presented. 
NACA FOUR-DIGIT-SERIES AIRFOILS 
Numbering system.-The numbering system for the 
NACA airfoils of the four-digit series (reference 1) is based 
on the airfoil geometry. The first integer indicates the 
maximum value of the mean-line ordinate Yc in percent of the 
chord. The second integer indicates the distance from the 
leading edge to the location of the maximum camber in 
tenths of the chord. The last two integers indicate the 
airfoil thickness in percent of the chord. Thus, the NACA 
2415 airfoil has 2-percent camber at 0.4 of the chord from the 
leading edge and is 15 percent thick. 
The first two integers taken together define the mean line. 
for example, the N ACA 24 mean line. The symmetrical air­
foil sections representing the thickness distribution for a 
family of airfoils are designated by zeros for the first two 
integers, as in the case of the N ACA 0015 airfoil. SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 5 
Thickness distributions.---Data for the NACA 0006,0008, 
0009, 0010, 0012, 0015, 0018, 0021, and 0024 thickness 
distributions are presented in the supplementary figures_ 
Ordinates for intermediate thicknesses may be obtained 
correctly by scaling the tabulated ordinates in proportion to 
the thickness ratio (reference 1). The leading-edge radius 
varies as the square of the thickness ratio. Values of 
(vIV)2, which is equivalent to the low-speed pressure distri­
bution, and of vlV are also presented. These data were 
obtained by Theodorsen's method (reference 9). Values of 
the velocity increments t::.va/F induced by changing angle 01 
attack (see section "Rapid Estimation of Pressure Distribu­
tions") are also presented for an additional lift coefficient of 
approximately unity. Values of the velocity ratio v/V for 
intermediate thickness ratios may be obtained approxi­
mately by linear scaling of the velocity increments obtained 
from the tabulated values of v/V for the nearest thickness 
ratio; thus, 
(5) 
Values of the velocity-increment ratio !::.Va/V may be obtained 
for intermediate thicknesses by interpolation. 
Mean lines.-Data for the NACA 62,63,64,65,66, and 67 
mean lines are presented in the supplementary figures. 
The data presented include the mean-line ordinates yo, the 
slope dYeldx, the design lift coefficient eli and the corre­
sponding design angle of attack ai, the moment coefficient 
cmei4' the resultant pressure coefficient PR, and the velocity 
ratio !::.v/V. The theoretical aerodynamic characteristics 
were obtained from thin-airfoil theory. All tabulated values 
for each mean line, accordingly, vary linearly with the maxi­
mum ordinate Ye, and data for similar mean lines with 
different amounts of camber within the usual range may be 
obtained simply by scaling the tabulated values. Data 
for the NACA 22 mean line may thus be obtained by multi­
plying the data for the N ACA 62 mean line by the ratio 2: 6, 
and for the NACA 44 mean line by multiplying the data for 
the NACA 64 mean line by the ratio 4:6. 
NACA 'FIVE.DIGIT-SERIES AIRFOILS 
Numberinl~ system.-The numbering system for airfoils of 
the NACAlive-digit series ,is based on a combination of 
theoretical aerodynamic characteristics and geometric char­
acteristics (references 2 and 3). The first integer indicates 
the amount ,pf camber in terms of the relative magnitude of 
the design Wit coefficient; the design lift coefficient in tenths 
is thus three-halves of the first integer. The second and third 
integers together indicate the distance from the leading edge 
to the locatlon of the maximum camber; this distance in 
percent of the chord is one-half the number represented by 
these integers. The last two integers indicate the airfoil 
thickness in percent of the chord. The NACA 23012 airfoil 
thus has a, ,aesign lift coefficient of 0.3, has its maximum 
camber at U percent of the chord, and has a thickness ratio 
of 12 percen~. Thickness distributions.--The thickness distributions for 
airfoils of the N ACA five-digit series are the same as those 
for airfoils of the NACA four-digit series. 
Mean lines.-Data for the NACA 210, 220, 230, 240, and 
250 mean lines are presented in the supplementary figures 
in the same form as for the mean lines given herein for the 
four-digit series. All tabulated values for each mean line 
vary linearly with the maxImum ordinate or with the design 
lift coefficient. Thus, data for the NACA 430 mean line 
ma,y be obtained by multiplying the data for the NACA 230 
mea,n line by the ratio 4:2 and for the NAOA 640 mean line 
by multiplying the data for the NACA 240 mean line by 
the ratio 6: 2. 
NACA l-SERIES AIRFOILS 
Numbering systern.-The NACA I-series airfoils are des­
ignated by a five-digit 'number-as, for example, the 
NACA 16-212 section. The first integer represents the 
series designation. The second integer indicates the dis­
tance in tenths of the chord from the leading edge to the 
position of minimum pressure for the symmetrical section 
at zero lift. The first number following the dash indicates 
the amount of camber expressed in terms of the design lift 
coefficient in tenths, and the last two numbers together 
indicate the thickness in percent of the chord_ The com­
monly used sections of this family have minimum pressure 
at 0.6 of the chord from the leading edge and are usually 
referred to as the NACA 16-seI'ies sections. 
Thickness distributions.-Data for the NACA 16-006, 
16-009, 16-012, 16-015, 16-018, and 16-021 thickness 
distributions (reference 10) are presented in the supplemen­
tary figures. These data are similar in form to the data for 
those airfoils of the N ACA four-digit series, and data for 
intermediate thickness ratios may be obtained in the same 
manner. 
Mean lines.-The NACA 16-series airfoils as commonly 
used are cambered with a mean line of the uniform-load 
type (a=1.0), which is described under the section for the 
N ACA 6-series airfoils that follows. If any other type of 
mean line is used, this fact should be stated in the airfoil 
d.esignation. 
NACA 6-SERIES AIRFOILS 
Numbering system.-The N ACA 6-set'ies airfoils are usu­
ally designated by a six-digit number together with a state­
ment showing the type of mean line used. For example, 
in the designation NACA 65,3-218, a=O.5, the "6" is 
the series designation. The" 5" denotes the chordwise 
position of minimum pressure in tenths of the chord behind 
the leading edge for the basic symmetrical section at zero 
lift. The" 3" following the comma gives the range of lift 
coefficient in tenths above and below the design lift coefficient 
in which favorable pressure gradients exist on both surfaces. 
The "2" following the dash gives the design lift eoefficient 
in tenths. The last two digits indicate the airfoil thickness 
in percent of the chord. The designation" a=0.5" shows 
the type of mean line used. When the mean-line designa­
tion is not given, it is understood that the uniform-load 
mean line (a= 1.0) has been used. 6 REPORT NO. 824-NA'rIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS 
When the mean line used is obt.ained by combining more t.han one mean line, the design lift. coefficient used in t.he designation is the algebraic sum of the design lift coefficients of the mean lines used, and the mea.n lines are described in the statement following the number as in the following case: 
NACA 65,3-218 ' {a=0.5 CII=O . .3 } 
a=l.O, Cli=-0.1 
Air'foils having a thickness distribution obtained by linearly increasing or decreasing the ordinates of one of the originally derived thickness distributions are designated as in the follow­ing example: 
NACA 65(318)-217, a=0.5 
The significance of all of the numbers except those in the parentheses is the same as before. The first number and the last two numbers enclosed in the parentheses denote, respec­tively, the low-drag range and the thickness in percent of the chord of the originally derived thickness distribution. 
The more recent NACA 6-sories airfoils are derived as members of thickness families having a simple relationship between the conformal transformations for airfoils of different thickness ratios but having minimum pressure at the samt;\ chord wise position. These airfoils are distinguished from thp earlier individually derived airfoils by writing the num­ber indicating the low-drag ra.nge as a. subscript; for exa.mple, 
NACA 653-218, a=0.5 
For NACA 6-se1'ies airfoils having a thickness ratio less than 0.12 of the chord, the subscript number indicating the low-drag range should be less than unity. Rather than usc a fmctional number, a subscript of unity was originally em­ployed for these airfoils. Since this usa.ge is not consistent with the previous definition of a number indicating the low­drag range, the designations of a.irfoil sections having a thick­ness ratio less than 0.12 of the chord are now given without such a number. As an example, an N AOA 6-series airfoil having a thickness ratio of 0.10 of the chord would be designated: 
NAOA 65-210 
Ordinates for the basic thiclniess distributions designated by a subscript are slightly different from those for the corre­sponding individually derived thickness distributions. As before, if the ordinates of the basic thickness distribution have been changed 1)Y a factor, the low-drag range and thick­ness ratio of the original thickness distribution are enclosed in parentheses as follows: 
NAOA 65(318)-217, a=O.5 
If, howevPJ', the ordinates of a basic thickness distribution having a thickness ratio less than 0.12 of the chord have been changed by a factor, 'the number indicating the low-drag range is eliminated and only the original thickness ratio is enclosed in parentheses as follows: 
NACA 65(10)-211 
If the design lift coefficient in tenths or the airfoil thickness in percent of chord are not whole integers, the numbers giving these quantities are usually enclosed in parentheses as in the following designation: NACA 65(318)-(1.5) (16.5), a=O.5 
Some early experimental airfoils are designated by the in­sertion of the letter "x" immediately preceding the hyphen as in the designation 66,2x-115. 
Thickness distributions.- Datafor available N AOA 6-series thickness forms are presented in the supplementary figures. These data are comparable with the similar data for airfoils of the NACA four-digit series, except that ordi­nates for intermediate thicknesses may not be correctly ob­tained by scaling the tabulated ordinates proportional to the thickness ratio. This method of changing the ordinates by a factor will, however, produce shapes satisfactorily approx­imating members of the family if the change in thickness ratio is small. Values of v/V and 6.v./V for intermediate thickness ratios may be approximated as described for the NACA four-digit series. 
Mean lines.-The mean lines commonly used with the NACA 6-series airfoils produce a uniform chordwise loading 
from the leading edge to the point ~=a and a linearly de­
creasing load from this point to the trailing edge. Data for NAOA mean lines with values of a equal to 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 are presented in the supplementary figures. The ordinates were computed by the following formula, which represents a simplification of the original expression for mean-line ordinates given in reference 11: 
x x x~ -c loge c+U-h c I (6) 
where 
1 [1 1 ] h=- -(1-a)210g (l-a)-- (1-a)2 +U I-a 2 . e 4 
The ideal angle of attack IXI corresponding to the design lift coefficient is given by 
Cit 
cx(==-h 27l'(a+D 
The data are presented for a design lift coefficient Cit equal to unity. All tabulated values vary directly with the design lift coefficient. Oorresponding data for similar mean lines with other design lift coefficients may accordingly be obtained simply by multiplying the tabulated values by the desired design lift coefficient. 
In order to camber NAOA 6-series airfoils, mean lines are usually used having values of a, equal to or greater than the distance from the leading edge to the location of minimum pressure for the selected thickness distribution at zero lift. For special purposes, load distributions other than those corresponding to the simple mean lines may be obtained by combining two or more types of mean line having positive or negative values of the design lift coefficient. The geometric SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 7 
and aerodynamic characteristics of such combinations may be 
obtained by algebraic addition of the values for the compo­
nent mean lines. 
NACA 7-SERIES AIRFOILS 
Numbering system.-The NACA 7-series airfoils are desig­
nated by a number of the following type (reference 12): 
NACA 747A315 
The first number "7" indicates the series number. The 
second number "4" indicates the extent over the upper sur­
face, in tenths of the chord from the leading edge, of the 
region of favorable pressure gradient at the design lift coeffi­
cient. The third number "7" indicates the extent over the 
lower surface, in tenths of the chord from the leading edge, 
of the region of favorable pressure gradient at the design lift 
coefficient. The significance of the last group of three num­
bers is the same as for the previous NACA 6-series airfoils. 
The letter "A" which follows the first three numbers is a 
serial letter to distinguish different airfoils having parameters 
that would correspond to the same numerical designation. 
For example, a second airfoil having the same extent of 
favorable pressure gradient over the' upper and lower sur­
faces, the same design lift coefficient, and the same maximum 
thickness as the original airfoil but having a different mean­
line combination or thickness distribution would have the

V '(upper surface) II I I I 1.6 
l 1 serial letter "B." Mean lines used for the NACA 7-series 
airfoils are obtained by combining two or more of the pre­
viously described mean lines. A list of the thickness dis­
tributions and mean lines used to form these airfoils is pre­
sented in table 1. The basic thickness distribution is given 
a designation similar to those of the final cambered airfoils. 
For example, the basic thickness distribution for the 
NACA 747A315 and 747A415 airfoils is given the designation 
NACA 747 A015 even though minimum pressure occurs at O.4c 
on both upper and lower surfaces at zero lift. Combination 
of this thickness distribution with the mean lines listed in 
table I for the NACA 747A315 airfoil changes the pressure 
distribution to the desired type as shown in figure 2. 
Thickness distributions.-Data for available NACA 7-
series thickness distributions are presented in the supple­
mentary figures. These thickness distributions are indi­
vidually derived and do not form thickness families. The 
thickness ratio may, however, be changed a moderate 
amount-say 1 or ,2 percent-by multiplying the tabulated 
ordinates by a suitable factor without seriously altering their 
characteristic features. Values of (V/V2) and of v/V for thinner 
or thicker thickness distributions may be approximated by 
the method of equation (5). If the change in thickness ratio 
is small, tabulated values of I1Va/V may be applied'directly 
with reasonable a.ccuracy.

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION~ 
A knowledge of the pressure distribution over an airfoil is 
desimble for structural design and for estimation of the 
critical Mach number and moment coefficient if tests are not 
available. The pressure distribution also exerts a strong 
or predominant influence on the boundary-layer flow and, 
hence, on the airfoil characteristics. It is therefore usually 
advisable to relate the airfoil characteristics to the pressure 
distribution rather than directly to the airfoil geometry. 
Methods of derivation of thickness distributions.-As 
mentioned in the section "Historical Development," the 
basic symmetrical thickness distributions of the N ACA 6-
and 7-series airfoils, together with their corresponding pres­
sure distributions, are derived by means of conformal trans­
formations. The transformations used to relate the known 
flow about a circle to that about an airfoil section were 
developed by Theodorsen in reference .9. Figure 3 shows 
schematically the significance of the various phases of the 
process. 
The circle about Which the flow is originally calculated has 
its center at the origin and a radius of aiD. The equation of

In order Jor the transformation (8) to be conformal, it is 
necessary that the quantity (f}-r/» (given the symbol -E) 
be the conjugate function of (1/I-if;0); that is, if E is represented 
by a Fourier series of the form 
'" '" e=L: An sin n</>-L: Bn cos n</> 
1 1 
then (if;-1/Io) is given by the relation 
'" '" (1/1-1/10)="'22 An cos nr/>+::8 Bn sin nr/> 
1 1 
This relationship indicates that, if the function E(r/» is given, 
(1/1-1/10) can be calculated as a function of r/>. Means of 
performing this calculation are presented in reference 13. 
The transformation relating the almost circular curve to 
tbe airfoil shape is 
(10) 
where f is the complex va.'iable in the airfoil plane. The 
coordinates of the airfoil x and yare the real and imaginary 
parts of f, respectively. These coordinates are given hy the

The basic symmetrical shapes were derived by assuming

chosen on the basis of pr~vious experience and are subject to 
the eonditions that 
L1J"~=o 
and de/de/> at e/> is equal to df/dcp at -cp. These conditions 
are hecessary for obtaining closed 'symmetrical shapes. 
Values of fCe/» were obtained simply by integrating ;; de/>. 
Values of o/(cp) were found by obtaining the conjugate of the 
curve of eCe/» and adding a value % suffieient to make the. 
,'alue of 0/ equal to zero at cp=1f'. This condition assures a 
sharp trailing-edge sbape. 
Inasmuch as small changes in the velocity distribution at any 
point of the surface are appr~ximately proportional to 1 + J; 
(see refrrence 14), the initially assumed values of df/de/> were 
altered by a process of successive approximations until the 
desired type of velocity distribution was obtained. After the 
final values of 0/ and e were obtained, the ordinates of thr basic 
thickness distribution were computed by equations (11) 
and (12). 
When these computations were made, it appeared that there 
was an optimum value of the leading-edge radius dependent. 
upon the airfoil thickness and the position of minimum 
pressure. If the leading-edge radius was too small, a pre­
mature peak in the pressure distribution occurred in the 
immediate v-icinity of thr leadi.ng edge as the angle of att.ack 
was increasrd. If the leading-edge radius was too large, a 
premature peak occurred a few prrcent of the chord behind thr 
lrading edge. With the COrI'rct l(lading-edge radius j t.he 
pressure distribut.ion became nearly flat over the forward 
portion of the airfoil before the normal leading-edge peak 
formed at the higher lift coefficients. Curves of the param­
eters 0/, f, dl/;/de/>, de/de/> plotted against e/> for the NACA 
643-018 airfoil section are given in figure 4. 
Experience has shown tl~at, ,,,,hen the thickness ratio of an 
originally derived basic form was increased merely by multi­
plying all the ordinates by a constant factor, an unnecessarily 
large decrease in the critical speed of the resulting section 
occurred. Reducing the thickness ratio in a similar manner 
caused an unnecessarily large decrease in the low-drag range. 
For this reason, each of the earlier N ACA 6-series sections was 
individually derived. It was later found that it was possible .16

multiplied by a eonstant faetor to obtain airfoils of various

tions in the resulting sect.ions. Each of the more recent 
families of NACA 6-series airfoils, in which numerical sub­
scripts are used in the designation, having minimum pressure 
at a given chordwise position was obtained by scaling up and 
down the basic values of the airfoil parameters 1/;, and E. 
Theoretical pressure distributions (indicated by (V)) 
for a, family of N ACA 65-series a.irfoils covering n range of 
thickness ratios are given in figure .5 (a). This figure shows 
the typical increase in the magnitude of the favorable pressure 
gradient, increase in maximum velocity over the surface, and 
increase in the relative pressure recovery over the rear portion 
of the airfoil'with increase in thickness ratio. Figure 5 (b) 
shows the pressure distrihution for a series of bnsic thickness 
forms having a thickness ratio of 0.15 and having minimum 
pressure at various chordwise positions. The value of the 
minimum pressure coefficient is seen to decrease and the 
magnitude of the pressure recovery over the renr portion of 
the airfoil to increase with the rearward movement of the 
point of minimum pressure. 10 REPOR'!' NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMIT'!'EE FOR AERONAU'rtCS

FIGURE 5.-Theoretical presmre distributions for some basic symmetrical NACA 6-series airfoils at zero lift. 
The pressure distribution for one of the basic symmetrical 
thickness distributions at various lift coefficients is shown in 
figure 6. At zero lift the pressure distributions over the 
upper and lower surfaces are the same. As the lift coefficient 
is increased, the slope of the pressure distribution over the 
forward portion of the upper surface decreases until it becomes 
flat at a lift coefficient of 0.22 (the end of the low-drag range). 
As the lift coefficient is increased beyond this value, the :usual 
peak in the pressure distribution forms at the lead~ng edge.

"load distribution" is used to signify the distribution along 
the chord of the normal force resulting from the difference in 
pressure on the upper and lower surfaces. 
The pressure distribution about any airfoil in potential 
flow may be calculated accurately by a generalization of the 
methods of the previous section. Although this method is 
not unduly laborious, the computations required are too 
long to permit quick and easy calculations for large numbers 
of airfoils .. The need for a simple method of quickly obtaining 
pressme distributions with engineering accuracy has led to 
the development of a method (reference 15) combining 
features of thin-and thick-airfoil theory. This simple 
method makes use of previously calculated characteristics 
of a limited number of mean lines and thickness distributions 
that may be combined to form large numbers of airfoils. 
Thin-airfoil theory (references 16 to 18) shows that the 
load distribution of a thin airfoil may be considered to consist 
of: (1) a basic distribution at the ideal angle of attack and 
(2) an additional distribution proportional to the angle of 
attack as measured from the ideal angle of attack. 
The first load distribution is a function only of the shape of 
the thin airfoil, or (if the thin airfoil is considered to be a 
mean line) of the mean-line geometry. Integration of this 
load distribution along the chord results in a normal-force 
coefficient which, at small angles of attack, is substantially 
equal to a lift coefficient Cit, which is designated the ideal 
or design lift coefficient. If, moreover, the camber of the 
mean line is changed by multiplying the mean-line ordinates 
by a constant factor, the resulting load distribution, the 
ideal or design angle of attack at and the design lift coefficient 
Cli may be obtaIned simply by mUltiplying the original values 
by the same fnctor. The characteristics of a large number of 
mean lines are presented in both graphical and tabular form 
in the supplementary figures. The load-distribution data 
are presented both in the form of the resultant pressure. 
coefficient PR and in the form of the corresponding velocity­
increment ratios !.lv/V. For positive design lift coefficie~ts, 
these velocity-increment ratios are positive on the upper SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 11 
!'Iudace and negative on the lower surface; the opposite is 
true for negative design lift coefficients. 
The second load distribution, which results from changing 
the angle of attack, is designated herein the" additional load 
distribution" and the corresponding lift coefficient is deRig­
nated the" additional lift coefficient." This additional load 
distribution contributes no moment about the quarter-chord 
point and, according to thin-airfoil theory, is independent of 
the airfoil geometry except for angle of attack. The addi­
tional load distribution obtained from thin-airfoil theory is 
of limited practical application, however, because this simple 
theory leads to infinite values of the velocity at the leading 
edge. This _difficulty is obviated by the exact thick-airfoil 
theory (reference 9) which also shows that the additional load 
distribution is neither completely independent of the aidoil 
shape nor exactly a linear function of the lift coefficient. 
For this reason, the additional load distribution ha,s been 
calculated by the methods of reference 9 for each of the thick­
ness distributions presented in the supplementary figures. 
These data are presented in the form of velocity-increment 
rat.ios AVa/V corresponding to an additional lift coefficient of 
approximately unity. For positive additional lift coeffi­
c:ients, these. velocity-increment ratios are positive on the 
upper surfaces and negat.ive on the lower surfaces; the 
opposite is true for negative additional lift coefficients. 
In additi~n to the pressure distributions associated with 
thes~ two load distributions, another pressure' distribution 
exists which is associated with the basic symmetrical thick­
ness form or thickness distribution of the airfoil. This pres­
sure distribution has been calculated by the methods 
described in the previous section for the condition of zero 
lift and is presented in the supplementary figures as ('f; )2, 
which is equivalent at low Mach numbers to the pressure 
coefficient S, and as the local velocity ratio VIV. This 
local velocity ratio is always positive and is the same for 
corresponding points on the upper and lower surfaces of the 
thickness form.· 
The velocity distribution about the airfoil is thus considered 
to be composed of three separate and independent com­
ponents as follows: 
(1) The distribution corresponding to the velocity dis­
tribution over the basic thickness form at zero angle of 
attack 
(2) The distribution corresponding to the design load 
distribution of the mean line 
(3) The distribution corresponding to the additional load 
distribution associated with angle of attack 
The velocity-increment ratios AviV and At'a/V correspond­
ing to components (2) and (3) are added to the velocity 
ratio corresponding to component (1) to obtain the total 
velocity at one point, from which the pressure coefficient S 
is obtained; thus, 
(14) 
When this formula is used, values of the ratios corresponding 
to one value of x are added together and the resulting value 
of the pressure coefficient S is assigned to the airfoil surface 
It t the same value of X. The values of. v/V and of ~v/V in equation (14) should, 
of course, correspond to the ·airfoil geometry. Methods 
of obtaining the proper values of these ratios from the values 
tabulated in the supplementary figures are presented in the 
previous section "Description of Airfoils. " 
When the ratio AvalV has the value of zero, the resulting 
distribution of the pressure coefficient S will correspond 
approximately to the pressure distribution of the airfoil 
section at the design lift coefficient Cli of the mean line, and 
the lift coefficient may be assigned this value as a first ap­
proximation. If the pressure-distribution diagram is inte­
grated, however, the value of Cl will be found to be greater 
than Cli by an amount dependent on the thickness ratio of 
the basic thickness form. . 
The pressure distribution will usually be desired at some 
specified lift coefficient not corresponding to Cli' For this 
purpose the ratio ~va/V must be assigned some value .ob­
tained by multiplying the tabulated value of this ratio by a 
factor j(a). For a first approximation this factor may be 
assigned the value 
(15) 
where CI is the lift coeffici(1nt for which the pressure distribu­
tion is desired. If greater accuracy is desired, the value of 
j(a) may be adjusted by trial and error to produce the 
actual desired lift coefficient as determined by integration 
of the pressure-distribution diagram. 
Although this method of superposition of velocities has 
inadequate theoretical justification, experience has shown 
that the results obtained are adequate for engineering use. 
In fact, the results of even the first approximations agree 
well with experimental data and are tl,dequate for at least 
preliminary consideration and selection of airfoils. A com­
parison of a first-approximation theoretical pressure distri­
bution with an experimental distribution is shown in figure 7.

Some discrepancy naturally occurs between the results of 
experiment and of any theoretical method based on potential 
flow'because of the presence of the boundary layer. These 
effects are small, however, over the range of lift coefficients 
for which the boundary layer is thin .and the drag coefficient 
ifllow. 
Numerical examples.-The following numerical examples 
are included to illustrate the method of obtaining the first­
approximation pressure distributions: 
Example 1: Find the pressure coefficient S at the station 
x=0.50 on the upper and lower surfaces of the NACA 
653-418 airfoil at a lift coefficient of 0.2. 
From the description of the NACA 6-series airfoils, it is 
determined that this airfoil is obtained by combining the 
NACA 653-018 basic thickness form with the a= 1.0 .type 
mean line cambered to a design lift coefficient of 0.4. The 
following data are obtained from the supplementary figures 
for this thickness form and mean line at x=0.50: 
v V=1.235 
~=0.157 
~=0.250 
The desired. value of AVa/V is computed as follows by use of 
equation (15): 
A~a=(0.157)(0.2-0.4) 
=-0.031 
The desired value of AV/V is obtained by multiplying the 
tabulated value by the design lift coefficient as stated in the 
description of the NACA 6-series airfoils. Thus, 
AV V = (0.250) (0.4) 
=0.100 
Substituting these values in equation (14) gives the following 
values of S: 
For the upper surface 
S= (1.235+0.100-0.031)2 
=1.700 
For the lower surface 
S= (1.235-0.100+0.031)2 
=1.360 
Example 2: Find the pressure coefficient S at the station 
x=0.25 on the upper and lower surfaces of the NACA 
65(215)-214, a=0.5 airfoil at a lift coefficient of 0.6. 
The airfoil designation shows that this airfoil was obtained 
by combining a thickness form obtained by multiplying' the 
ordinates of the NACA 652-015 form by the factor 14/15 
with the a=0.5 type mean line cambered to a design lift 
coefficient of 0.2. The supplementary figures give a value of 1.182 for v/V 
atx=0.25 for the NACA 652-015 basic thickness form. The 
desired value of v/V is obtained by applying formula (5) 
as follows: 
v 14 V=(1.182-1) 15+1 
=1.170 
From the supplementary figures the following values of 
AVa/V are obtained at x=0.25 for the following basic thickness 
forms: 
By interpolation the value of AVa/V of 0.287 may be 
assigned to the 14-percent-thick form. The desired value of 
AVa/V is then computed as follows by use of equation (15): 
A'v Va=(0.287) (0.6-0.2) 
=0.115 
Data presented in the supplementary figures for the a=0.5 
type mean lines give the value of 0.333 for Av/V at x=0.25. 
As stated in the description of the NACA 6-series airfoils, 
the desired value of AV/V is obtained by multiplying the 
tabulated value by the design lift coefficient. Thus, 
~ = (0,333) (0.2) 
=0.067 
Substituting the foregoing values in equation (14) gives the 
values of S as follows: 
For the upper surface 
S= (1.170+0.067 +0.115)2 
=1.828 
For the lower surface 
S= (1.170-0.067 -0.115)2 
=0.976 
Example 3: Find the pressure coefficient S at the station 
x=0.30 on the upper and lower surfaces of the NACA 2412 
airfoil at a lift coefficient of 0.5. 
The description of airfoils of the NACA four-digit series 
shows that the necessary data may be found from the NACA 
0012 thickness form and 64 mean line in the supplementary 
figures. From these figures the following data are obtained:

airfoils; thus,

The desired value of b.va/V is obtained from equation (15) 
as follows:

Substituting the proper values in equation (14) gives the

For the lower surface

Effect of camber on pressure distribution.-At zero lift the

(a) Amount of camber. at the design lift coefficient is to separate the pressures on 
the upper and lower surfaces by an amount corresponding 
approximately to the design load distribution of the mean 
line. When the local value of the design load distribution is 
positive, the pressure coefficient S on the upper' surface .is 
increased (decreased absolute pressure) whereas that on the 
lower surface is decreased. This effect is shown in figure 8 (a) 
for various amounts of camber. 
The maximum value of the pressure coefficient on the upper 
surface at the design lift coefficient increases with the design 
lift coefficient and for a given design lift coefficient increases. 
with decreasing values of a. The result is to cause the critical 
Mach number at the design lift coefficient to decrease with 
increasing camber or with the use of types of mean line con­
centrating the load near' the leading edge. Figure 8 (b) 
shows that the location of minimum pressure on both surfaces 
is not affected if a type of mean line is used having a value of 
a at least as large as the value of x/e at the position of 
minimum pressure on the basic thickness distribution. If a 
mean line with a smaller value of a is used, the possible extent, 
of laminar flow along the upper surface will be reduced. 
CRITICAL MACH NUMBER 
The critical speed is defined as the free-stream speed at 
which the velocity at any point along the surface of the air­
foil reaches the local velocity of sound. If the maximum value­
of the low-speed pressure coefficient S is known either experi­
mentally or from theoretical methods, the criti~al Mach,

the Mach numbers at which large changes in airfoil char­
acteristics occur, especially when sharp pressure peaks exist 
at the leading edge. A discussion of the characteristics of 
airfoil sections at supercritical Mach numbers is beyond the 
scop'e of this report. 
For convenience, curves of predicted critical Mach num­
ber plotted against the low-speed section lift coefficient have 
been included in the supplementary figures for a number of 
airfoils. High-speed lift coefficients may be obtained by 
multiplying the low-speed lift coefficient by the factor 
1 . 
..jl"'::'W· 'I'he critical Mach numbers have been predicted 
from theoretical pressure distributions. For airfoils of the 
NACA four-and five-digit series and for the NACA 7-series 
airfoils, the theoretical pressure distributions were obtained 
by Theodorsen's method. For the other airfoils the theo­
retical pressure distributions were obtained by the approxi­
mate method described in the preceding section. 
The data in the supplementary figures show that, for any 
one type of airfoil, the maximum critical Mach number 
decreases rapidly as the thickness is increased. The effect 
of camber is to lower the maximum critical Mach number 
and to shift the range of high critical Mach numbers iii the 
same manner as for the low drag range. For common types 
of camber the minimum reduction in critical speed for a 
given design lift coefficient is obtained with a uniform load 
type of mean line. A comparison of the data presented in 
the supplementary figures shows that N ACA 6-series sec­
tions have consi<ierably higher maximum critical Mach 
numbers than NACA 24-, 44-, and 230-series airfoils of 
corresponding thickness ratios. 
MOMENT COEFFICIENTS 
Methods of calculation.-Theoretical moment coefficients 
may be approximated directly from the values presented in 
the supplementary figures for the various mean lines. These 
values were obtained from thin-airfoil theory and may be 
scaled up or down linearly with the design lift coefficient or 
with the mean-line ordinates. These theoretical values are 
sufficiently accurate for preliminary considerations, but ex­
perimental values should be used for stability and control 
calculations. 
Numerical examples.-The following numerical examples 
illustrate the methods of calculating the moment coefficients: 
Example 1: Find the theoretical moment coefficient about 
the quarter-chord point for the NACA 652-215, a=0.5 
airfoil. 
The designation of the airfoil shows that the design lift 
coefficient of this airfoil is 0.2. From the data on the 
NACA a=0.5 type mean line included inthe supplementary 
figures, the value of C"'c/4 is -0.139 for a design lift coefficient 
of 1.0. The desired value of the moment coefficient. is 
accordingly

moment coefficient for this mean line is -0.157. The

data by using the theoretical value of the lift-curve slope 
for thin airfoils, 2'lr per radian. The value of alo in degrees 
is then

2'lr SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 15 
DESCRIPTION OF FLOW AROUND AIRFOILS 
Perfect-fluid theory postulates that the flow follow the 
airfoil contour smoothly at all angles of attack with no loss 
of energy. Consequently, perfect-fluid theory itself gives 
no information concerning the profile drag or the maximum 
lift of airfoil sections. The explanation of these phenomena 
is found from a consideration of the effects of viscosity, 
which are of primary importance in a thin region near the 
surface of the airfoil called the boundary layer. 
Boundary layers in general are of two types, namely, 
laminar and turbulent. The flow in the laminar layer is 
smooth and free from any eddying motion. The flow in the 
turbulent layer is characterized by the presence of a large 
number of relatively small eddies. Because the eddies in the 
turbulent layer produce a transfer of momentum from the 
relatively fast-moving outer parts of the boundary layer to 
the portions closer to the surface, the distribution of average 
velocity is characterized by relatively higher velocities near 
the surface and a greater total boundary-layer thickness in 
. a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar' boundary layer 
developed under otherwise identical conditions. Skin fric­
tion is therefore higher for turbulent boundary-layer flow 
than for laminar flow. 
When the pressures along the airfoil surface are increasing 
in the direction of flow, a general deceleration takes place. At 
the outer limits of the boundary layer this deceleration takes 
place in accordance with Bernoulli's law. Closer to the sur­
face, no such simple law can be given because of the action 
of the viscous forces within the boundary layer. In general, 
however, the relative loss of speed is somewhat greater for 
particles of fluid within the boundary layer than for those at 
the outer limits of the layer because the reduced kinetic 
energy of the boundary-layer air limits its ability to flow 
against the adverse pressure gradient. If the rise in pressure 
is sufficiently great, portions of the fluid within the boundary 
layer may actually have their direction of motion reversed 
and may start moving upstream. When this reverse occurs, 
the flow in the boundary layer is said to be "separated." 
Because of the increased interchange of momentum from 
different parts of the layer, turbulent boundary layers are 
much more resistant to separation than are laminar layers. 
Laminar boundary layers can only exist for a relatively shQrt 
distance in a region in which the pressure increases in the 
direction of flow. Formulas for calculating many of the 
boundary-layereharacteristics are given in references 20 to 22. 
After laminar separation occurs, the flow may either 
leave the surface permanently or reattach itself in the form 
of a turbulent boundary layer. Not much is known concern­
ing the factors controlling this phenomenon. Laminar sep­
aration on wings is usually not permanent at flight values of 
the Reynolds number except when it occurs near the leading 
edge under conditions corresponding to maximum lift. The 
size of the locally separated region that is formed when the 
laminar boundary layer separates and the flow returns to the 
surface decreases with increasing Reynolds number at a 
given angle of attack. 
The flow over aerodynamically smooth airfoils at low and 
moderate lift coefficients is characterized by laminar boundary 
layers from the leading edge back to approximately the loca­
tion of the first minimum-pressure point on both upper and lower surfaces. If the region of laminar flow is extensive, 
separation occur", immediately downstream from the location 
of minimum pressure (reference 20) and the flow returns to 
the surface almost immediately at flight Reynolds numbers 
as a turbulent boundary layer. This turbulent boundary 
layer extends to the trailing edge. If the surfaces are not 
sufficiently smooth and fair, if the air stream is turbulent, 
or perhaps if the Reynolds number is sufficiently large, tran.:. 
sition from laminar to turbulent flow may occur anywhere 
upstream of the calculated laminar separation point. 
For low and moderate lift coefficients where inappreciable 
separation occurs, the airfoil profile drag is largely caused by 
skin friction and the value of the drag coefficient depends 
mainly on the relative amounts of laminar and turbulent 
flow. If the location of transition is known or assumed, the 
drag coefficient may be calculated with reasonable accuracy 
from boundary-layer theory by use of the methods of 
references 23 and 24. 
As the lift coefficient of the airfoil is increased by changing 
the angle of attack, the resulting application of the additional 
type of lift distribution moves the minimum-pressure point 
upstream on the upper surface, and the possible extent of 
laminar flow is thus reduced. The resulting greater propor':' 
tion of turbulent flow, together with the larger average veloc­
ity of flow over the surfaces, causes the drag to increase with 
lift coefficient. 
In the case of many of the older types of airfoils, this 
forward movement of transition is gradual and the resulting 
variation of drag with lift coefficient occurs smoothly. The 
pressure distributions for NACA 6-series airfoils are such as 
to cause transition to move forward suddenly at the end of 
the low-drag range of lift coefficients. A sharp increase in 
drag coefficient to the value corresponding to a forward loca­
tion of transition on the upper surface results. Such sudden 
shifts in transition give the typical drag curve for these air­
foils with a "sag" or "bucket" in the low-drag range. The 
same characteristic is shown to a smaller degree by some of 
the earlier airfoils such as t~e NACA 23015 when tested in 
fl, low-turbulence stream. 
At high lift coefficients, a large part of the drag is contrib­
uted by pressure or form drag resulting from separation of 
the flow from the surface. The flow over the upper surface is 
characterized by a negative pressure peak near the leading 
edge, which causes laminar separation. The onset of tur­
bulence causes the flow to return to the surface as a turbulent 
boundary layer. High Reynolds numbers are favorable to . 
the development of turbulence and aid in this process. If 
the lift coefficient is sufficiently high or if the reestablish­
ment of flow following laminar separation is unduly delayed 
by low Reynolds numbers, the turbulent layer will separate 
from the surface near the trailing edge and will cause large 
drag increases. The eventual loss in lift with increasing 
angle of attack may result either from relatively sudden 
permanent separation of the laminar boundary layer near 
the leading edge or from progressive forward movement of 
turbulent separation. Under the latter condition, the flow 
over a relatively large portion of the surface may be separated 
prior to maximum lift. A more extended discussion of the 
flow conditions associated with maximum lift is given in 
reference 5. 16 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS 
EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS 
SOURCES OF DATA 
The primary source of the wind-tunnel data presented is 
from tests in the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence 
pressure timnel (TDT). The methods, used to obtain and 
correct the data are summarized in the appendix. Design 
data obtained from tests of 2-foot-chord models in this 
tunnel are presented in the supplementary figures. 
Some wind-tunnel data presented were' obtained in other 
NACA wind tunnels. In each case, the source of the data 
is indicated and the testing techniques and corrections used 
were conventional unless otherwise indicated. 
Most of the flight data consist of drag measurements made 
by the wake-survey method on either the airplane \\ing or it 
"glove" fitted over the wing as the test specimen. When­
ever the measurements were obtained for a glove, this fact 
is indicated in the presentation of the data. All data obtained 
at high speeds have been reduced to cofficient form by 
compressible-flow methods. In the case of all such 
NACA flight data, precautions have 'been taken to ensure 
that the results presented are not invalidated by cross 
flows of low-energy air into or out of the survey plane. 
DRAG CHARACTERISTICS OF SMOOTd AIRFOILS 
Drag characteristics in.low~drag range.--The value of the 
drag coefficient in the low-drag range for smooth airfoils is 
mainly a function of the Reynolds number and the relative 
extent of the laminar layer and is moderately affected by the 
airfoil thickness ratio and camber. The effect on minimum 
drag of the position of minimum pressure which determines 
the possible extent of laminar flow is shown in figure 9 for 
some NACA 6-series airfoils. The data show a regular 
decrease in drag coefficient with rearward movement of 
minimum pressure.

FIGUllE 10.-Va"iation of minimum section drag coefficient with Reynolds number for several 
airfoils, together with laminar and turbulent skin-friction coefficients for a flat plate. 
tested was a practical-construction model. It may be noted 
that the drag coefficient for the NACA 653-418 airfoil at low 
Reynolds numbers is substantially higher than that of the 
NACA 0012, whereas at high Reynolds numbers the opposite 
is the case. The higher drag of the NACA 653-418 airfoil 
section at low Reynolds numbers is caused by a relatively 
extensive region of laminar separation downstream of the 
point of minimum pressure. This region decreases in size 
with increasing Reynolds number. These data illustrate the 
inadequacy of low Reynolds number test data either to esti­
mate the full-scale characteristics or t~ determine the relative 
merits of airfoil sections at flight Reynolds numbers (refer­
ences 25 and 26). 
The variation of minimum drag coefficient with camber is 
shown in figure 11 for a number of smooth 18-percent-thick 
NACA 6-series airfoils. These data show very little change

FIGFRE 12.-Variation of minimum section drag coefficient with airfoil thickness ratio for 
several NACA airfoil seNions of differel1', cal"bc~s in both smooth and rough conditions. 
R = 6 X 106• The data presented in the supplementary figures for the 
NACA 6-series thickness forms show that the range of lift 
coefficients for low drag varies markedly with airfoil thick­
ness. It has been possible to design airfoils of 12~percent 
thickness with a total theoretical low-drag range of lift coeffi­
cients of 0.2. This theoretical range increases by ~pprox­
imately 0.2 for each 3-percent increase of airfoil thickness. 
Figure 13 shows that the theoretical extent of the low-drag 
range is approximately realized at a Reynolds number of 
9 X 106. Figure 13 also shows a characteristic tenclE'ncy for 
the drag to increase to some extent toward the upper end of 
the low-drag range for moderately cambered airfoils, pai'­
ticularly for the thicker airfoils. All data for the X ACA 
6-series airfoils show a decrease in the extent of the IO\'l-drag 
range with increasing Reynolds number. Extrapolation of 
the rate of decrease observed at Reynolds numbers below 
9X 106 would indicat(> a vanishingly small low-drag range at 
flight values of the Reynolds number. Tests of a carefully 
constructed model of the XACA 65(421)-420 airfoil showed, 
however, that the rate of reduction of the low-drag range 
with increasing Reynolds number decreased markedly at 
Reynolds numbers above 9X 106 (fig. 14). These data indi­
cate that the extent of the low-drag range of this airfoil is 
reduced to about olH'-half the theoretical value at a Reynolds 
number of 35 X 106•

and 691. 
The values of the lift coefficient for which low d.rag is 
obtained are determined largely by the amount of camber. 
The lift coefficient at the center of the low-drag range corre­
sponds approximately to the design lift coefficient of the 
mean line. The effect on the drag characteristics of various 
amounts of camber is shown in figure 15. Section data indi­
cate that the location of the low-drag range may be shifted 
by even such crude camber changes as those caused by small 
deflections of a plain flap. (See supplementary fig.) 18 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS

ness with various amounts of camber. R = 6 X 106; TDT tests 163, 314, 802, 813, and 830. 
The location of the low-drag range shows some variation 
from that predicted by simple thin-airfoil theory; This de­
parture appears to be a function of the type of mean line 
used (reference 27) and the airfoil thickness. The effect of 
airfoil thickness is shown in figure 13, from which the center 
'of the low-drag range is seen to shift to higher lift coefficients 
with increasing airfoil thickness. This shift is partly ex­
plained by the increase in lift coefficient above the design 
lift coefficient for the mean line obtained when the velocity 
increments caused by the mean lirie are combined with thp 
velocity distribution for the basic thickness form according 
to the approximate methods previously described. Drag' characteristics outside low-drag range.-At the end 
of the low~drag range the drag increases rapidly with increase 
in lift coefficient. For symmetrical and low-cambered air­
foils, for which the lift coefficient at the upper end of the 
low-drag range is moderate, this high rate of increase does 
not continue. (See fig. 15.) For highly cambered sections; 
for which the lift at the upper end of the low-drag range is 
already high, the drag coefficient shows a continued rapid 
mcrease. 
Comparison of data for airfoils cambered with a uniform­
load mean line with data for airfoils cambered to carry the 
load farther forward shows that the uniform-load mean line 
is favorable for obtaining low drag coefficient.s at high lift 
coefficients (fig. 16 'and reference 27). 
Data for many of the airfoils given in the supplementary 
figures s~ow large reductions in drag with increasing Reynolds 
number at high lift coefficients. This scale effect is too large 
to be accounted for by the normal variation in skin friction 
and appears to be associated with the effect of Reynolds 
number on the onset of turbulent flow following laminar 
separation near the leading edge (reference 28). 
Effects of type of section on drag characteristics.-A com­
parison of the drag characteristics of the NACA 23012 and of 
three NACA 6-series airfoils is presented in figure 17_ The 
drag for the NACA 6-series sections is substantially lower 
than for the NACA 23012 section in the range of lift coeffi­
cients corresponding to high-speed flight, and this margin 
may usually be maintained through the range of lift coeffi­
cients useful for cruising by suitable choice of camber. 
The NACA 6-series sections show the higher maximum values 
of the lift-drag ratio. At high values of the lift coefficient, 
however, the earlier NACA sections have generally lower 
drag coefficients than the NACA 6.-series airfoils. 3.6

W SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 21 
Effective aspect ratio.-The combination of high drags at 
high lift coefficients, low drags at moderate lift coefficients, 
and the nonregular variation of drag with lift coefficient 
shown by the NACA 6-series airfoils may lead to para­
doxical results when the span-efficiency concept (reference 29) 
is used for the calculation of airplane performance. In the 
usual application of this concept, the airplane drag charac­
tc!ristics are approximated by a curve of the type 
(17) 
This curve is usually matched to the actual drag character­
istics at a rather low and at a moderately high value of the 
lift coefficient (reference 30). 
The application of this concept to two hypothetical air­
planes with N ACA 230-. and (}5~.series sections, respectively, 
is illustrated in figure 18 (a). The wing drags of the air­
planes have been calculated by adding the induced drags 
corresponding to an aspect ratio of 10 with elliptical loading 
to the profile-drag coefficients of the NACA 23018 and 
653-418 airfoils. These sections are considered representa­
tive of average wing sections for a large airplane of this 
aspect ratio. Ordinate scales are given in figure 18 (a) for 
the wing drag and for the total airplane drag coefficients 
obtained by adding a representative constant value of

coefficients have been approximated by two curves corre­
sponding to equation (17) and matched to the drag curves 
at lift coefficients of 0.2 and 1.0. These two curves corre­
spond to effective aspect ratios of 9.29 for the airplane with 
NAOA 23018 sections and of 8.30 for the airplane with 
NACA 653-418 sections and illustrate the typical large 
reduction in the effective aspect ratio obtained with such 
sections. 
It should be noted, however, that although equation (17) 
provides a reasonably satisfactory approximation to the 
drag of the airplane with NACA 23018 sections, such is not 
the case for the airplane with the NAOA 653-418 section. 
The most important reason for using high aspect ratios on 
large airplane3 is to reduce the drag at cruising lift coefficients 
and to obtain high maximum values of the lift-drag ratio. 
For the two wings considered, the maximum value of this 
ratio is appreciably higher for the airplane with NACA 
653-418 sections (19.8 as compared with 18.5) despite the 
fact that this airplane shows the lower effective aspect ratio. 
Figure 18 (b) shows a similar comparison with similar 
results for two airplanes of aspect ratio 8 and NACA 2415 
and 652-415 airfoils. It is accordingly concluded that the 
effective aspeCt ratio is not a satisfactory criterion for use in 
airfoil selection .

EFFECT OF SURFACE IRREGULARITIES ON DRAG 
Permissible roughness.-Previous work has shown large 
drag increments resulting from surface roughness. (reference 
31). Although a large part of these drag increments was 
shown to result from forward movement of transition, sub­
stantial drag inGrements resulted from surface roughness in 
the region of turbulent flow. It is accordingly important to 
maintain smooth surfaces even when extensive laminar 
flow cannot be expected, but the gains that may be expected 
from maintaining smooth surfaces are grAater for NACA 6-
or 7 -series airfoils when extensive laminar flows are possible. 
No accurate method of specifying the surface condition 
necessary for extensive laminar flow at high Reynolds num­
bers has been developed, although some general conclusions 
have been reached. It may be presumed that for a given 
Reynolds number and chordwise position, the size of the 
permissible roughness will vary directly with the chord of 
the airfoil. It is known, at one extreme, that the surfaces 
do not have to be polished or optically smooth. Such 
polishing or waxing has shown no improvement in tests in 
the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnels when 
applied to satisfactorily sanded surfaces. Polishing or waxing 
a sllrfacethat is not Iterodynamically smooth wiH, of course, 
result in improvement and such finishes may be of consider­
able practical value because deterioration of. the finish may 
be easily Seen and pmlsibly postponed. Large models having 
chord lengths of 5 to 8 feet tested in the Langley two­
dImensional low-turbulence tunnels are usually finished by 
sanding in the chordwise direction with N o. 3~0 carborundum 
paper when an aerodynamically smooth surface is desired. 
Experience has shown the resulting finish to be satisfactory 
at flight values of the Reynolds number. Any' rougher 
surface texture should be considered as a possible source of 
transition, although slightly rougher surfaces have appeared 
to produce satisfactory results in some cases. C 
Wind-tunnel experience in testing NACA 6-series sections 
and data of reference 32 show that small protuberances 
extending above the general surface level of an otherwise 
satisfactory surface are more likely to cause transition than 
small depressions. Dust particles, for example, are more 
effective than ,small scratches in producing transition if the 
material at the edges of the scratches is not forced above the 
general surface level. Dust particles adheI:ing to the oil 
left on airfoil surfaces by fingerprints may be expected to 
cause transition at high Reynolds numbers. 
Transition spreads from an individual disturbance with an 
included angle of about 15° (references 31 and 33). A few 
scattered specks, especially near the leading edge,' will cause 
the flow to be largely turbulent. This fact makes necessary 
an extremely thorough inspection if. low drags are to be 
realized. Specks sufficiently large to cause . premature 
transition on full-size wings can be felt by hand. The in­
spection procedure used in the Langley two-dimensional 
low-turbulence tunnels is to feel the entire surface by hand 
after which the surface is thoroughly wiped with a dry cloth. 
It has been noticed that transition resulting froin individual small sharp protuberances, in contrast to waves, tends to 
occur at the protuberance. Transition caused by surface 
waviness appears to approach t:Qe waVe gradually as the 
Reynolds number or wave size is increased. The height 
of a small cylindrical protuberance necessary to cause transi­
tion when located at 5 percent of the chord with its axis 
normal to the surface is shown in figure 19. These data were

obtained at rather low values of the Reynolds number and 
show a large decrease in allowable height with increase in 
Reynolds number. This, effect of Reyn?lds number on 
permissible surface roughness is also evident in figure 20, 
in which a sharp increase in drag at a Reynolds number of 
approximately 20 X 106 occurs for the model painted with 
camouflage lacquer. 
The magnitude of the favorable gradient appears to have a 
small effect on the permissible surface roughness for laminar 
flow. Figure 21 shows that the roughness becomes more 
important at the extremities of the low-drag range where 
the favorable pressure gradient is reduced on one surface. 
The effect of increasing the Reynolds number for a sllrface 
of marginal smoothness, which has an effect similar to in­
creasing the surface roughness for a given Reynolds number, 
is to reduce rapidly the extent of the 19w-drag range and 
then to increase the minimum drag coefficient (fig. 21). 
The data of figure 21 were specially chosen to show this 
effect. In most cases, the effect of Reynolds number pre­
dominates over the effect of decreasing the magnitude of the 
favorable pressure gradient to such an extent that the only 
effect is the elimination of the low-drag range (reference 34). 
Permissible waviness.-More difficulty is generally en­
countered in reducing the waviness to permissible values for 
the maintenance of laminar flow than in obtaining the re­
quired surface smoothness. In addition, the specification 
of the required freedom from surface waviness is more 
difficult than that of the required surface smoothness. The 
problem is not limited merely to finding the minimum wave 
size that will cause transition under given conditions because 
the number of waves and the shape of the waves require 
consideration. SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DA'l'A 23

TDT tests 300 and 486. 
If the wave is sufficiently large to affect the pressure 
distribution in such a manner that laminar separation is 
encountered, there is little doubt that such a wave will cause 
premature transition at all useful Reynolds numbers. A re­
lation between the dimension€; of a wave and' the pressure 
distribution may be found by the method of reference 35. 
The size of the wave required to reverse the favorable pres­
sure gradient increases with the pressure gradient. Large 
negative pressure gradients would therefore appear to be 
favorable for wavy surfaces. Experimental results have 
shown this conclusion to be qualitatively correct. 
Little information is available on waves too small to cause laminar separation or even reversal of the pressure gradient. 
Data for an airfoil section having a relatively long wave on 
the upper surface are given in figure 22. Marked increases 
in the drag corresponding to a rapid forward movement of 
the transition point were not noticeable below a Reynolds 
number of 44 X 106• On the other hand, transition has been 
caused at comparatively low Reynolds numbers by a series 
of small waves with a wave height of the order of a few ten­
thousandths of an inch and a wave length of the order of 
2 inches on the same 60-inch-chord model. 
For the types of wave usually encountered on practical­
construction wings, the test of rocking a straightedge over 
the surface in a chord wise direction 'is a fairly satisfactory 
criterion. The straightedge should rock smoothly without 
jarring or clicking. The straightedge test will not show the 
existence of waves that leave the surface convex, such as the 
wave of figure 22 and the series of small waves previously 
mentioned. Tests of a large number of practical-construction 
models, however, ·have shown that those models which 
passed the straightedge test were sufficiently free of small 
waves to permit low drags to be obtained at flight values of 
the Reynolds number. 
It is not feasible to specify construction tolerances on air­
foil ordinates with sufficient accuracy to ensure adequate 
freedom from waviness. If care is taken to obtain fair 
surfaces, normal tolerances may be used without causing 
serious alteration of the drag characteristics. 24 ItEPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE F'OR AERONAUTICS

Dra.g with fixed transition.---If the airfoil surface is suffi­
ciently rough to cause transition near the leading edge, large 
drag increases are to be expected. Figure 23 shows that, 
although the degree of roughness has some effect, the incre­
ment in minimum drag coefficient cau~ed by the smallest 
roughness capable of producing transition is nearly as great 
as that caused by much larger grain roughness when the 
roughness is confined to the leading edge. The degree of 
roughness has a much larger effect on the drag at high lift 
coefficients. If the roughness is sufficiently large to cause 
transition at all Reynolds numbers considered, the drag of 
the airfoil with roughness only at the leading edge decreases 
with increasing Reynolds number (fig. 10 and reference 36). 
The effect of fixing transition by means of a roughness 
strip of carborundum of O.Oll-inch grain is shown in figur(~ 24. 
The minimum drag increases progressively with forward 
movement of the roughness strip. The effE'ct on the drag 
at high lift coefficients is not progressive; the drag increases 
rapidly when the roughness is at the leading edge. Figure 25 
shows that the drag coefficients for the NACA 65(223)-422 
and 63(420)-422 airfoils were nearly the same throughout 
most of the lift range when the extent of laminar flow was 
limited to 0.30c. 
All recent airfoil data obtained in the Langley two-dimen­
sional low-turbulence pressure tunnel include results with 
roughened leading edge, and these data are included in the 
supplementary figures. Tests with roughened leading edge 
were formerly made. only for a limited number of airfoil 
sections, especially those having large thickness ratios 
(reference 37). The standard roughness selected for 24-inch­
chord models consists of O.Oll-inch carborundum grains 
applied to the airfoil surface at the leading edge over a surface 
length of 0.08c measured from the leading edge on both sur­
faces. The grains are thinly spread to cover 5 to 10 percent 
of this area. This standard roughness is considerably more 
severe than that caused by the usual manufacturing irregu­
larities or deterioration in service but is considerably less 
severe than that likely to be encountered in service as a result of accumulation of ice or mud or damage in military 
combat. 
The variation of minimum drag coefficient with thickness 
ratio for a number of NACA airfoils with standard roughness 
is shown in figure 12. These data show that the magnitudes 
of the minimum drag coefficients for the NACA 6-series 
airfoils are less than the values for the NACA four-and 
five-digit-series airfoils. The rate of increase of drag with 
thickness is greater for the airfoils in the rough condition 
than in the smooth condition. 
Drag with practical construction methods.- The section 
drag coefficients of several airplane wings have been measured 
in flight by the wake-survey method (reference 38), and a 
number of practical-construction wing sections have been 
tested in the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence 
pressure tunnel at flight values of the Reynolds number. 
Flight data obtained by the NACA (referenee 38) arc sum­
marized in figure 26 and some data obtained by the Consoli­
dated Vultee Aircraft Corporation are presented in figure 27. 
Data obtained in the Langley two-dimensional low­
turbulenee pressure tunnel for typical praetical-construction 
sections are presented in figures 28 to 32. Figure 33 presents 
a comparison of the drag coefficients obtained in this wind 
tunnel for a model of the NACA 0012 section and in flight 
for the same model mounted on an airplane. For this case, 
the wind-tunnel and flight data agree to within the experi­
mental error. 
All wings for which flight data art' pres('nted in figure 2() 
were earefully finished to produce smooth surfaces. Great 
care was taken to reduce surface waviness to a minimum 
for all the sections except the NACA 2414.5, the N-22, the 
Republic 8-3,13, and the NACA 27-212. Curvature-gage 
measurements of surface wavinE'ss for some of these airfoils 
are presented in referE'nce 38. Surface eonditions correspond­
ing to the data of figure 27 arc descri.bed in the figure. 
These data show that the sections permitting extensive 
laminar flow had substantially lower drag coefficients when 
smooth than the other sections. 3.6

FIGURE 25.-Drag characteristics of two NACA 6·series airfoils with O.Oll·inch-grain

The wind-tunnel tests of practical-construction wing sec­
tions as delivered by the manufacturer showed minimum 
drag coefficients of the order of 0.0070 to 0.0080 in nearly all 
cases rpgardless of the airfoil section used (figs. 28 to 32). 
Such values may be regarded as typical for good current 
construction practice. Finishing the sections to produce 
smooth surfaces always produced substantial drag reductions 
although considerable waviness usually remained. None of 
the sections tested had fair surfaces at the front spar. Unless 
speeial care is taken to produce fair surfaces at the front spar, 
the resulting wave may be expected to cause transition either 
at the spar location or a short distance behind it. One 
practical-eonstruction specimen tested with smooth surfaces 
maintained relatively low drags up to Reynolds numbers 
of approximately 30X106 (NACA 66(2x15)-116 airfoil of 
fig. 10)~ This specimen had no spar forward of about 35 
percent chord from the leading edge and no spanwise stiffeners 
forward of the spars. This type of construction resulted in 
unusually fair surfaces and is being used on some modern 
high-performanee airplanes. 
A comparison of the effect of airfoil section on the mini­
mum drag with practical-construetion surfaces is very diffi­
eult because the quality of the surface has more effect on 
the drag than the type of section. Probably the best com­
parison can be obtained from pairs of models construeted at 32 X 106

FIGURE 34.-Effect of de-ieers on the drag of two practical-construction airfoil sections with relatively smooth surfaces. 
Important savings in drag may be obtained at high 
Reynolds numbers by keeping the surfaces smooth even if 
extensive laminar flow is not realized. Drag increments resul t-
o ing from surface roughness in turbulent flow have been shown 
to be important (reference 31). The effects of surface roughness 
on the variation of drag with Reynolds number are shown 
in figure 29, in which the favorable scale effect usually expected 
at high Reynolds numbers was not realized_ This type of 
scale effect may be compared with that shown for the NACA 
63(420)-422 airfoil with rough leading edge but otherwise 
smooth surfaces (fig. 10). Drag increments obtained in 
flight resulting from roughness in the turbulent boundary 
layer with fixed transition are presented in reference 39, 
The effect of the application of de-icers to the leading edge 
of two smooth airfoils is shown in figure 34. The de-icer 
"boots" were installed in both cases by the manufacturer to

coefficients for both sections with de-icers installed were of 
the order of 0.0070 at high Reynolds numbers. 
Effects of propeller slipstream and airplane vibration.­
Very few data are available on the effect of propeller slip­
stream on transition or airfoil drag; the data that are avail­
able do not show consistent results. This inconsistency may 
result from variations in lift coefficient, surface condition, 
air-stream turbulence, propeller advance-diameter ratio, and 
number of blades. Tests in the Langley 8-foot high-speed 
tunnel indicated transition occurring from 5 to 10 percent of 
the chord from the leading edge (reference 40). Drag measure­
ments made in the Langley 19-foot pressure tunnel (fig. 35) 
indicated only moderate drag increments resulting from a 
windmilling propeller. Although the data of figure 35 may 
not be very accurate because of the difficulty of making 
wake surveys in the slipstreaml these data seem to preclude 
very large drag increments such as would result from move· 
ment of the transition to a position close to the leading edge. 
These data also seem to be confirmed by recent NACA flight 
data (fig. 36), which show transition as far back as 20 percent

of the chord in the slipstream. Other unpublished NACA 
flight data on transition on an 8-3,14.6 airfoil in the slip­
stream indicated that laminar flow occurred as far back 
as 0.2c. 
Even less data are available on the effects of vibration on 
transition. Tests in the Langley 8-foot high-speed tunnel 
(reference 40) showed negligible effects, but the range of 
frequencies tested may not have been sufficiently wide. Some 
unpublished flight data showed small but consistent rear­
ward movements of transition outside the slipstream when 
the propellers were feathered. This effect was noticed even 
when the propeller on the opposite side of the airplane from 
the survey plane was feathered and was accordingly attrib­
uted to vibration. Recent tests in the Ames full-scale tun­
nel showed premature adverse scale effect on drag coefficients 
measured by the wake-survey method when a model-support 
strut vibrated. 
LIFT CHARACTERiSTICS OF SMOOTH AIRFOILS 
Two-dimensional data.-As explained in the section "Angle 
of Zero Lift," the angle of zero lift of an airfoil is largely 
determined by the camber. Thin-airfoil theory provides a 
means for computing the angle of zero lift from the mean-line 
data presented in the supplementary figures. The agree­
ment between the calculated and the experimental angle of 
zero lift depends on the type of mean line used. Comparison 
of the experimental values of the angle of zero lift obtained 
from the supplementary figures and the theoretical values 
taken from the mean-line data shows that the agreement is 
good except for the uniform-load type (a=1.0) mean line. 
The angles of zero lift for this type mean line generally have 
values more positive than those predicted. The experi~ 
mental va,lues of the angles of zero lift for a number of NACA 
four-and five-digit and NACA 6-serie::; airfoils are presented 
in figure 37. The. airfoil thickness appears to have little effect 
on the value of the angle of zero lift regardless of the airfoil 
series. For the NACA four-digit-series airfoils, the angles of 
zero lift are approximately 0.93 of the value given by thin­
airfoil theory; for the NACA 230-series airfoils, this factor is 
approximately 1.08; and for the NAOA 6-series airfoils with 
uniform-load type mean line, this factor is approximately 
0.74. 
The lift-curve slopes (fig. 38) for airfoils tested in the 
'Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence pressure tunnel are 
higher than those previously obtained in the tests reported 
in reference 8. It is not clear whether this difference in slope 
is caused by the difference in air-stream turbulence or by 
the differences in test .methods, since the section data of 
reference 8 were inferred from tests of models of aspect ratio 6. 
The present values of the lift-curve slope were measured for 
a Reynolds number of 6 X 106 and at values of the lift coeffi­
cient approximately equal to the design lift coefficient of the airfoil section. For the NACA 6-series airfoils this lift coeffi­
cient is approximately in the center of the low-drag range. 
For airfoils having thicknesses in the range from 6 to 10 per­
cent, the NAOA four-and five-digit series and the NAOA 
. 64-series airfoil sections have values of lift-curve slope very 
close to the value for thin airfoils (271' per radian or 0.110 per 
degree). Variation in Reynolds number between 3XI06 and 
9X 106 and variations in airfoil camber up to 4 percent chord 
appear to have no systematic effect on values of lift-curve 
slope. The airfoil thickness and the type of thickness 
distribution appear to be the primary variables. For the 
NAOA four-and five-digit-series airfoil sections, the lift­
curve 'slope decreases with increase in airfoil thickness. 
For the NAOA {i-series airfoil sections, however, the lift­
curve slope increases with increase in thickness and forward 
movement of the position of minimum pressure of the basic 
thickness form at zero lift. 
Some N AOA 6-series airfoils show jogs in the lift curve 
at the end of the low-drag range, especially at low Reynolds 
numbers. This jog becomes more pronounced with increase 
of camber or thickness and with rearward movement of the 
position of minimum pressure. on the basic thickness form. 
This jog decreases rapidly in severity with increasing Rey­
nolds number, becomes merely a change in lift-curve slope, 
and is practically nonexistent at a Reynolds number of 
, 9 X 106 for most airfoils that would be considered for practical 
application. This jog may be a consideration in the selection 
of airfoils for small low-speed airplanes. An analysis of 
the flow conditions leading to this jog is presented in refer­
ence 28. 
The variation of maximum lift coefficient with airfoil 
thickness ratio at a Reynolds number of 6 Xl 06 is shown in 
figure 39 for a number of N AOA airfoil sections. The airfoils 
for which data are presented in this figure have a range of 
thickness ratio from 6 to 24 percent and cambers up to 
4 percent chord. From the data for the NAOA four-and 
five-digit-series airfoil sections (fig. 39 (a»), the maximum 
lift coefficients for the plain airfoils appear to be the greatest 
for a thickness of 12 percent. In general, the rate of change 
'of maximum lift coefficient with thickness ratio appears 
to be greatest for· airfoils having a thickness less than 12 
percent. The data for the NAOA 6-series airfoils (figs. 
39 (b) to 39 (e» also show a rapid increase in maximum lift 
coefficient with increasing thickness ratio for thickness 
ratios of less than 12 percent. For NAOA 6-series airfoil 
sections cambered to give a design lift coefficient of not more 
than 0.2, the optimum thickness ratio for maximum lift 
coefficient appears to be between 12 and 15 percent, except 
for the airfoils having the position of minimum pressure at 
60 percent chord. The optimum thickness ratio for the 
NAOA 56-series sections cambered for a design lift coeffi­
cient of not more than 0.2 appears to be 15 percent or greater. SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 31

FIGURE 38.-Variation of lift-curve slope with airfoil thickness ratio and camber for a number of NACA airfoil sections in both the smooth and rough conditions. R=6XI06. 
The available data indicate that a thickness ratio of 12 
percent or less is optimum for airfoils having a design lift 
coefficient of 0.4. 
The maximum lift coefficient is least sensitive to variations 
in position of minimum pressure on the basic thickness form 
for airfoils having thickness ratios of 6, 18, or 21 percent. 
The maximum lift coefficients corresponding to intermediate 
thickness ratios increase with forward movement of the 
position of minimum pressure, particularly for those airfoils 
having design lift 'coefficients of 0.2 or less. 
The maximum lift coefficients of moderately cambered ~NACA 6-series sections increase with increasing camber 
(fig. 39 (b) to 39 (e». The addition of camber to the sym­
metrical airfoils causes the greatest increments of maximum 
lift coefficient for airfoil thickness ratios varying from 6 to 
12 percent. The effectiveness of camber as a means of 
increasing the maximum lift coefficient generally decreases 
as the airfoil thickness increases beyond 12 or 15 percent. 
The available data indicate that the combination of a 12-
percent-thick section and a mean line cambered for a design 
lift coefficient of 0.4 yields the highest maximum lift 
coefficient. 2.B

roughness. R=6X106• 34 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISOIW COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS 
The variation of maximum lift with type of mean line is 
shown in figure 40 for one 6-series thickness distribution. 
No systematic data are available for mean lines with values 
of a less than 0.5. It should be noted,however, that airfoils 
such as the N ACA 230-series sections with the maximum 
camber far forward show large values of maximum lift. 
Airfoil sections with maximum camber far forward and with 
thickness ratios of 6 to 12 percent usually stall from the 
leading edge with large sudden losses in lift. A more de­
sirable gradual stall is obtained when the location of maxi­
mum camber is farther back, as for the NACA 24-,44-, and 
6-series sections with normal types of camber.

65a-418 airfoil sections from tests in the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence pressure 
tunnel. 
A comparison of the maximum lift coefficients of NACA 
64-series airfoil sections cambered for a design lift coefficient 
of 0.4 with those of the NACA 44-and 230-series sections 
(fig. 39) shows that the maximum lift coefficients of the 
NACA 64-series airfoils are as high or higher than those of 
the NACA 44-series sections in all cases. The NACA 230-
series airfoil sections have maximum lift coefficients some­
what higher than those of the NACA 64-series sections. 
The scale effect on the maximum lift coefficient of a large 
number of NACA airfoil sections for Reynolds numbers 
from 3 X 106 to 9 X 106 is shown in figure 41. The scale 
effect for the NACA 24-, 44-, and 230~series airfoils (figs. 
41 (a) and 41 (b» having thickness ratios from 12 t024 percent 
is favorable and nearly independent of the airfoil thickness. 
IIwreasing the Reynolds number from 3 X 106 to 9 X 106 
results in an increase in the maximum lift cO('fficient of approximately 0.15 to 0.20. The scale effect on the NACA 
00-and 14-series airfoils having thickness ratios less than 
0.12c is very small. 
The scale-effect data for the NACA 6-series airfoils (figs. 
41 (c) tv 41 (f» do not show an entirely systematic variation. 
In general, the scale effect is favorable for these airfoil 
sections. For the NACA 63-and 64-series airfoils with 
small camber, the increase iIi maximum lift coefficient with 
increase in Reynolds number is generally small for thicknes.s 
ratios of less than ·12 percent but is somewhat larger for the 
thicker sections. The character of the scale effect for the 
NACA 65-and 66-series airfoil sections is similar to that for 
the NACA 63-and 64-series airfoils but the trends are not 
so well defined. In most cases the scale effect· for NACA 
6-series airfoil sections cambered for a design lift coefficient 
of 0.4 or 0.6 does not vary much with airfoil thickness ratio. 
The data of figure 42 show that, the maximum lift coefficient 
for the NACA 63(420)-422 airfoil continues to increase with 
Reynolds number, at least up to a Reynolds number of 
26X106• 
The values of the maximum lift coefficient presented were 
obtained for steady conditions. The maximum lift coeffi­
cient may be higher when the angle of attack is increasing. 
Such a condition might occur during gusts and landing 
maneuvers. (See reference 41.) 
The systematic investigation of NACA 6-series airfoils 
included tests of the airfoils with a simulated split flap de­
flected 60°. It. was believed that these tests would serve as 
an indication of the effectiveness of more powerful types of 
trailing-edge high-lift devices although sufficient data to verify 
this assumption have not been obtained. The maximum lift 
coefficients for a large number of NACA airfoil sections 
obtained from tests with the simulated split flap are presented 
in figure 39. 
The data for the NACA 00-and 14-series airfoils equipped 
with split flap for thickness ratios from 6 to 12 percent show 
a considerable increase in maximum lift coefficient with in­
crease in thickness ratio. Corresponding data for the NACA 
44-series airfoils wit,h thickness ratios from 12 to 24 percent 
show very little variation in maximum lift coefficient with 
thickness. For NACA 6-sel'ies airfoils equipped with split 
flaps the maximum lift coefficients increase rapidly with 
increasing thickness Over a range of thickness ratio, the range 
beginning at thickness ratios between 6 and 9 percent, depend­
ing upon the camber. The upper limit of this range for the 
symmetrical NACA 64-and 65-series airfoils appears to be 
greater than 21 percent and for the NACA 63-and 66-series 
airfoils, approximately 18 percent. Between thickness ratios 
of 6 and 9 percent the values of maximum lift coefficient for 
the symmetrical N ACA 6-series airfoils are essentially the 
same regardless of thickness ratio and position of minimum 
pressure on the basic thickness form. The maximum lift 
coefficient decreases with rearward movement of minimum 
pressure for the airfoils having t,hickness ratios between 9 and 
18 percent. .0 2.

Ul SUMMARY 0]' AIRFOIL DATA 37 
Substantial increments in maximum lift coefficient with 
increase in camber are shown for the N ACA 6-series airfoils 
of moderate thickness ratios (10 to 15 percent chord) with 
split flaps. For the airfoils having thickness ratios of 6 
percent and for the airfoils having thickness ratios of 18 or 21 
percent, the maximum lift coefficient is affected very little by 
a change in camber. For thickness ratios greater than 15 
percent, the maximum lift coefficients of the N ACA 63-and 
64-series airfoils cambered for a design lift coefficient of 0.4 
equipped with split flaps are greater than the corresponding 
maximum lift coefficients of the NACA 44-series airfoils. 
Three-dimensional data.-No recent systematic three­
dimensional wing data obtained at high Reynolds numbers 
are available, so that it is difficult to make any comparison 
with the section data. When the maximum-lift data for 
three-dimensional wings are compared with section data, 
account should be taken of the span load distribution over 
the wing. The predicted maximum lift coefficient for the 
wing will be somewhat lower than the maximum lift coeffi­
cients of the sections used because of the nonuniformity of 
the spanwise distribution of lift coefficient. The difference 
amounts to about 4 to 7 percent for a rectangular wing with 
an aspect ratio of 6. 
Maximum-lift data obtained from tests of a number of 
wings and airplane models in the Langley 19-foot pressure 
tunnel are presented in table II. Although section data at 
the Reynolds numbers necessary to permit a detailed com­
parisonare not available, the maximum lift coefficient for 
plain wings given in table II appears to be in general agree­
ment with values expected from section data. The data for 
the airplane'models are presented to indicate the maximum 
lift coefficients obtained with varIOUS airfoils and 
eonfigurations. 
LIFT CHARACTERISTICS OF ROUGH AIRFOILS 
Two-dimensional data.-Most recent airfoil tests, espe­
cially of airfoils with the thicker sections, have included tests 
with roughened leading edge (reference 37), and the available 
data are included in the supplementary figures. 
The effect on maximum lift coefficient of various degrees 
of roughness applied to the leading edge of the NACA 
63(420)-422 airfoil is shown in figure 23. The maximum lift 
coefficient decreases progressively with increasing roughness 
(reference 36). For a given surface condition at the leading 
edge, the maximum lift coefficient increases slowly with 
increasing Reynolds number (fig. 43). Figure 24 shows that 
roughness strips located more than 0.20e from the leading 
edge have littie effect on the maximum lift coefficient or 
lift-curve slope. The results presented in figure 38 show 
that the effect of standard leading edge roughness is to de­
crease the mt-curve slope, particularly for the thicker air­
foils having the position of minimum pressure far back. 
These data are for a Reynolds number of 6X 106• Maximum-20

lift-coefficient data at a Reynolds number of 6 X 106 for a 
large number of NACA airfoil sections with standard rough­
ness are presented in figures 39 and 41. The variation of 
maxi~um lift coefficient with thickness for the NACA four·· 
and five-digit-series airfoil sections shows the same trends 
for the airfoils with roughness as for the smooth airfoils 
except that the values are considerably reduced for all of 
these airfoils other than the N ACA OO-series airfoils of 
6 percent thickness. For a given thickness ratio greater than 
15 percent, the values of maximum lift coefficient for the 
four-and five-digit-series airfoils are substantially the same. 
Much less variation in maximum lift coefficient with thick­
ness ratio is shown by the NACA 6-series airfoil sections in 
the rough condition than with smooth leading edge. The 
maximum lift coefficients of the 6-percent-thick airfoils are 
essentially the same for both smooth and rough conditions. 
The variation of maximum lift coefficient with camber, how­
ever, is about the same for the airfoils with standard rough­
ness as for the smooth sections. The maximum lift coeffi­
cient of airfoils with standard roughness generally decreases 
somewhat with rearward movement of the position of mini­
mum pressure except for airfoils having thickness ratios 
greater than 18 percent, in which case some slight gain in 
maximum lift coefficient results from 3, rearward movement 
of the position of minimum pressure. 
Except for the NACA 44-series airfoils of 12 to 1.'5 percent 
thickness, the present data indicate that the rough NACA 
64-series airfoil sections cambered for a design lift coefficient 
of 0.4 have maximum lift coefficients consistently higher than 
the rough airfoils of the NACA 24-, 44-, and 230-series air­
foils of comparable thickness. Standard roughness causes 
decrements in maximum lift coefficient of the airfoils with 
split flaps that are substantially the same as those observed 
for the plain airfoi.ls. 38

'l, The maximum lift coefficient may be lowered by failure to 
maintain the true airfoil contour near the leading edge, but 
no systematic data on this ·effect have been obtained. Ex­
amples of this effect that were accidentally encountered are 
presented in figure 44, in which lift characteristics are given 
for accurate and slightly inaccurate models. The model 
inaccuracies were so small that they were not found previous 
to the tests. 
Three-dimensional data.-Tests of several airplanes in the 
Langley full-scale tunnel (reference 42) show that many fac­
tors besides the airfoil sections affect the maximum lift co­
efficient of airplanes. Such factors as roughness, leakage, 
leading-edge air intakes, armament installations, nacelles, 
and fuselages make it difficult to correlate the airplane maxi­
mum lift with the airfoils used, even when the flaps are 
retracted. The various flap configurations used make such 
a correlation even more difficult when the flaps are deflected. 
When the flaps were retracted, both the highest and the 
lowest maximum lift coefficients obtained in recent tests of 
airplanes and complete mock-ups of conventional configura­
tions in the Langley full-scale tunnel were those obtained 
with NACA 6-series airfoils.

the Langley 19-foot pressure tunnel and of the airplane in 
the Langley full-scale tunnel are presented in figure 45. 
Both tests were made at approximately the same Reynolds 
number. The results show that the airplane in the service 
condition had a maximum lift coefficient more than 0.2 
lower than that of the model, as wljll as a lower lift-curve 
slope. Some improvement in the airplane lift characteristics 
was obtained by sealing leaks. These results show that air­
plane lift characteristics are strongly affected by details not 
reproduced on large-scale smooth models. SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 39

Lift characteristics obtained in the IJangley 19-foot pres­
sure tunnel for two airplane models in the smooth condition 
and with transition fixed at the front spar are presented in 
figures 46 and 47. In both cases, the Ilft-curve slope was de­
creased throughout most of the lift range with fixed transi­
tion. The maximum lift coefficient was decreased in one 
case but was increased in the other case. 
UNCONSERVATIVE AIRFOILS 
The attempt to obtain low drags, especially for long-range 
airplanes, leads to high wing loadings together with relatively 
low span loadings. This tendency results in wings of high 
aspect ratio that require large spar depths for structural 
efficiency. The largp-spar depths require the use of thick 
root sections. 
This trend to thick root sections has been encouraged by 
the relatively small increase in drag coefficient with thickness 
ratio of smooth airfoils (fig. 12). Unfortunately, airplane 
wings are not usually constructed with smooth surfaces and, 
in any case, the surfaces cannot be relied upon to stay smooth 
under all service conditions. The effect of roughening the 
leading edges of thick airfoils is to cause large increases in the I. 6

drag coefficient at high lift coefficients. The resulting drag 
coefficients may be excessive at cruising lift coefficients for 
heavily loaded, high-altitude airplanes. Airfoil sections that 
have suitable characteristics when smooth but have excessive 
drag coefficients when rough at lift coefficients corre­
sponding to cruising or climbing conditions are classified as 
unconservative. 
The decision as to whether a given airfoil section is conserv­
ative will depend upon the power and the wing loading of 
the airplane. The decision may be affected by expected 
service and operating conditions. For example, the ability 
of a multiengine airplane to fly with one or more engines in­
operative in icing conditions or after suffering damage in 
combat may be a consideration. 
. As an aid in judging whether the sections are conservative, 
the lift coefficient corresponding to a drag coefficient of 0.02 
was determined from the supplementary figures for a large 
number of NACA airfoil sections with roughened leading 
edges. The variation of this critical lift coefficient with air­
foil thickness ratio and camber is shown in figure 48. These 
data show that, in general, the lift coefficient at which the 
. drag coefficient is 0.02 decreases with rearward movement of 40 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS

which this lift coefficient is a maximum usually lies between 
12 and 15 percent; variations in thickness ratio from this 
optimum range generally cause rather sharp decreases in the 
critical lift coe'lficient. The addition of camber to the 
symmetrical airfoils usually causes an increase in the critical 
lift coefficient except for the very thick sections, in which case 
increasing the camber becomes relatively ineffectual and may 
be actually harmful. All the data of figure 48 correspond to 
a Reynolds number of 6XI06• As shown in figure 49, the 
drag coefficient at flight values of the Reynolds number may 
be considerably lower than the drag coefficient at a Reynolds 
num bel' of 6 X 106 if the roughness is confined to the leading 
edge. 
PITCHING MOMENT 
The variation of the quarter-chord pitching-moment coef­
ficient at zero angle of attack with airfoil thickness ratio and 
camber is presented in figure 50 for several NACA airfoil 
sec.tions. The quarter-chord pitching-moment coefficients of 
the NACA four-and five-digit-series airfoils become less 
negative with increasing airfoil thickness. Almost no varia­
tion in quarter-chord pitching-moment coefficient with air­
foil thickness ratio or position of minimum pressure is shown 
by the NACA 6-series aiffoil sections. As might be expected, 
increasing the amount of camber causes an almost uniform 
negative increase in the pitching-moment coefficient. 
As discussed previously, the pitching moment of an airfoil 
section is primarily a function of its camber, and thin-airfoil 
theory provides a means for estimating the pitching moment 
from the mean-line data presented in the supplementary 
figures. A comparison of the experimental moment coeffi­
cient and theoretical values for the mean lines is presented 
in figure 51. The experimental values of the moment coeffi­
cients for NACA 6-series airfoils cambered with the uniform­
load type mean line are usually about three-quarters of the 
theoretical values (figs. 50 and 51). Airfoils employing mean 
lines with values of a less than unity, however, have moment 
coefficients somewhat more negative than those indicated by 
theory. The use of a mean line having a value of a less than 
unity, therefore, brings about only a slight reduction in 
pitching-moment coefficient for a given design lift coefficient 
when compared with the value obtained with a uniform­
load type mean line. The experimental moment coefficients 
for the NACA 24-, 44-, and 230-series airfoils are also less 
negative than those indicated by theory but the agreement 
is closer than for airfoils having the uniform-load type mean 
line. 
The pitching-moment data for the airfoils equipped with 
simulated split flaps deflected 60° (fig. 50) indicate that the 
value of the quarter-chord pitching·moment coefficient be­
comes more negative with increasing thickness for all the 
airfoils tested. For the thicker NACA 6-series sections the 
magnitude of the moment coefficient increases with rearward 
movement of the position of minimum pressure. 3.6

POSITION OF AERODYNAMIC CENTER 
The variation of chordwise position of the aerodynamic 
center corresponding to a Reynolds number of 6 X 106 for a 
large number of NACA airfoils is presented in figure 52. 
From the data given in the supplementary figures there 
appears to be no systematic variation of chordwise position 
of aerodynamic center with Reynolds number. The data 
for the NACA 00-and 14-series airfoils, presented for thick­
ness ratios less than 12 percent, show that the chordwise 
position of the aerodynamic center is at the quarter-chord 
point and does not vary with airfoil thickness. For the 
NACA 24-, 44-, and 230-series airfoils with thickness ratios 
ranging from 12 to 24 percent, the chord wise position of the 
aerodynamic center is ahead of the quarter-chord point and 
moves forward with increase in thickness ratio. 
The chordwise position of the aerodynamic center is behind 
the quarter-chord point for the NACA 6-series airfoils and 
moves rearward with increase in airfoil thickness, which is 
in accordance with the trends indicated by perfect-fluid 
theory. There appears to be no systematic variation of 
chordwise position of the aerodynamic center with camber or 
position of minimum pressure on the basic thickness form for 
these airfoils. 
The data of reference 43 show important forward move­
ments of the aerodynamic center with increasing trailing-edge 
angle for a given airfoil thickness. For the NACA 24-, 44-, 
and 230-series airfoils (fig. 52) the effect of increasing 
trailing-edge angle is apparently greater than the effect of increasing thickness. For the N ACA 6-series airfoils, the 
opposite appears to be the case. 
HIGH-LIFT DEVICES 
Lift characteristics for two NACA 6-series airfoils equipped 
with plain flaps are presented in figure 53. These data 
show that the maximum lift coefficient increases less rapidly 
with flap deflection for the more highly cambered section. 
Lift characteristics of three NACA 6-series airfoils with split 
flaps are presented in reference 44 and figure 54. The maxi­
mum-lift increments for the 12-percent-thick sections were 
only about three-fourths of that increment for the 16-percent­
thick section. The maximum lift coefficient for the thicker 
section with flap deflected is about the same as that obtained 
for the NACA 23012 airfoil in the now obsolete Langley 
variable-density tunnel (reference 45) and in the Langley 
7-by lO-foot tunnel (reference 46). 
Tests of a number of slotted flaps on N ACA 6-series 
airfoils (supplementary figures and reference 47) indicate that 
the design parameters necessary to obtain high maximum 
lifts are essentially similar to those for the the N ACA 230-
series sections (references 48 and 49). Lift data obtained 
for typical hinged single slotted 0.25c flaps (fig. 55 (a» on 
the NACA 63,4-420 airfoil are presented in figure 55 (b). 
A maximum lift coefficient of approximately 2.95 was ob­
tained for one of the flaps. Lift characteristics for the 
NACA 653-118 airfoil fitted with a double slotted flap 
(reference 47 and fig. 56 (a» are presented in figure 56 (b). 
A maximum lift coefficient of 3.28 was obtained. It may 
be concluded that no special difficulties exist in obtaining 
high maximum lift coefficients with slotted flaps on moderately 
thick N ACA 6-series sections. 
Tests of airplanes in the Langley full-scale tunnel (reference 
42) have shown that expected increments of maximum lift 
coefficient are obtained for split flaps (fig. 57) but not for 
slotted flaps (fig. 58). This failure to obtain the expected 
maximum-lift increments with slotted flaps may be attributed 
to inaccuracies of flap contour and location, roughness near 
the flap leading edge, leakage, interference from flap sup­
ports, and deflection of flap and lip under load. 
LATERAL-CONTROL DEVICES 
An adequate discussion of lateral-control devices is outside 
the scope of this report. The following brief discussion is 
therefore limited to considerations of effects of airfoil shape 
on aileron characteristics. 
The effect of airfoil shape on aileron effectiveness may be 
inferred from the data of figure 59 and reference 50. The 
section aileron effectiveness parameter Aaol Ao is plotted 
against the aileron-chord ratio Calc for a number of airfoils 
of different type in figure 59. Also shown in this figure 
are the theoretical values of the parameter for thin airfoils. 44

The data show no large consistent trends of aileron-effective­
ness variation with airfoil section for a wide range of thick­
ness distributions and thickness ratios. In order to evaluate 
aileron characteristics from section data, a method of analysis 
is necessary that will lead to results comparable to the usual 
curves of stick force against helix angle pb/2V for three­
dimensional data. The analysis that follows is considered 
suitable for comparing the relative merits of ailerons from 
two-dimensional data. 
Two-dimensional data are presented in the form of the 
eq uivalent change in section angle of attack Aao required to 
maintain a constant section lift coefficient for various de­
flections of the aileron from neutral. This equivalent change 
in angle of attack is plotted against the hinge-moment param­
eter ACHO, which is the product of the aileron deflection 
from neutral and the resulting increment of hinge-moment .~

coefficient based on the wing chord. This method of analysis 
takes into account the aileron effectiveness, the hinge 
moments, and the possible mechanical advantage between 
the controls and the ailerons. The larger the value of Aao 
for a given value of the hinge-moment parameter, the more 
ad vantageous the combination should be for providing a 
large value of pb/2V for a given control force. The assump­
tion that the aileron operates at a constant lift coefficient 
as the airplane rolls is not entirely correct, however, and 
involves an overestimation of the effect of changing angle 
of attack on the hinge-moment coefficient. In addition, 
the span of the ailerons and other possible three-dimensional 
effects are not considered. In spite of these inaccuracies, 
the method provides a useful means of comparing the two­
dimensional characteristics of different ailerons. (a) f 1.000----------------~

For the purpose of evaluating the effect of airfoil shape on 
the aileron characteristics, it is desirable to make the com­
parison with unbalanced ailerons to avoid confusion. Plots 
of the parameters for plain unbalanced flaps of true airfoil 
contour on threE' airfoil sections are shown in figure 60. 
The characteristics of the NACA 66(215)-216, a=0.6 section 
are essentially the same as those for the NACA 0009 airfoil 
within tIll' range of deflection for which data are available. 
The NACA 64,2-(1.4) (13.5) airfoil shows appreciably 
smaller valuE'S of 6.CIIO for a given value of 6.0:0 than the other 
sections prE'sented. No explanation for this difference can 
be offered, although some of the difference may result from 
the slightly smaller chord of the flap for this combination. 
The effects of using straight-sided ailE'rons instE'ad of ailer­
ons of true airfoil contour are shown in figure 61 for two 
N ACA 6-series airfoils. One of the two combinations for 
which data are available was provided with an internal 
balance whE'reas the other combination was without balance. 
This differencE' prevents any comparison between the two 
combinations but doE'S not affect comparison of the two

able. It appears, however, that the straight-sided aileron 
would be lE'sS advantageous than the aileron of true contour 
for positive dE'flections greater than 12°. In the case of 
the NACA 63,4-4(17.8) (approx.) airfoil, the straight­
sidE'd aileron appears to have no advantage over the aileron 
of true airfoil contour. The advantage of using straight­
sided ailerons appears to depend markedly on the airfoil used 
but sufficient data are not available to determine the signif­
icant airfoil parameters. Figure 62 shows that in one case 
the effE'ct of leading-edge roughness on the aileron character­
istics is unfavorable. 
LEADING-EDGE AIR INTAKES 
The problem of designing satisfactory leading-edge air 
intakes is to maintain the lift, drag, and critical-speed 
characteristics of the sections while providing low intake 
losses over a wide range of lift coefficients and intake velocity 
ratios. The data of reference 65 show that desirable intake 
and drag characteristics can easily be maintained over a 
rather small range of lift coefficients for NACA 6-series air­
foils. The data of reference 65 show that the intake losses 
increase rapidly at moderately high lift coefficients for the 
shapes tested. Unpublished data taken at the Langley 
Laboratory indicate that shapes such as those of reference 
65 have low maximum lift coefficients. Recent data show 50 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADYlSORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS

distribution data for the air intakes shown in figure 63 in­
dicate that the critical speed of the section has been lowered 
only slightly and that falling pressures in the direction of 
flow were maintained for some distance from the leading 
edge on both surfaces at lift coefficients near the design lift 
coefficient for the section. Sufficient information is not 
available to permit such desirable configurations to be de­
signed without experimental development. 
INTERFERENCE 
The main problem of interference at low Mach numbers)s 
considered to be that of avoiding boundary-layer separation 
resulting from rapid flow expansions caused by the addition 
of induced velocities about bodies and the boundary-layer 
accumulations near intersections. No recent systematic 
investigations of interference such as the investigation of 
reference 66 have been made. 
Some tests have been made of airfoil sections with in­
tersecting flat plates (reference 67). These configurations 
may be considered to represent approximately the condition 
of a wing intersection with a large flat-sided fuselage.:.i:1n

this case, the interference may be considered to result from 
the effect on the wing of the fully developed turbulent bound­
ary layer on the fuselage or flat plate and the accumulation of 
boundary layer in the intersection. These tests showed 
little interference except in cases for which the boundary 
layer on the airfoil alone was approaching conditions of 
separation such as were noted with the less conservative 
airfoils at moderately high lift coefficients. 
Some scattered data on the characteristics of nacelles 
mounted on airfoils permitting extensive laminar fl.ow are 
presented in references 68 to 70. The data appear to in­
dicate that the interference problems for conservative NACA 
6-series sections are similar to those encountered with other 
types of airfoil. The detail shapes 'for optimum interfering 
bodies and fillets may, however, be different for various 
sections if local excessive expansions in the flow are to be 
avoided. 
Some lift and drag data for an airfoil with pusher-propeller­
shaft housings are presented in reference 71. These results 
indicate that protuberances near the trailing edge of wings 
should be carefully designed to avoid unnecessary drag 
increments. 
Another type of interference of particular importance for 
high-speed airplanes results in the reduction of the critical 
Mach number of the combination because of the addition of 
the induced velocities associated with each body (reference 
72). This effect may be kept to a minimum by the use of 
bodies with low induced velocities, by separation of inter­
fering bodies to the greatest possible extent, and by such 
selection and arrangement of combinations that the points 
of maximum induced velocity for each body do not coincide. 
APPLICATION TO WING DESIGN 
Detail consideration of the various factors affecting wing 
design lies outside the scope of this report. The following 
discussion is therefore limited to some important aerodyna­
mic features that must be considered in the application of 
the data presented. 
APPLICATION OF SECTION DATA 
Wing characteristics are usually predicted from airfoil­
section data by use of methods based on simple lifting-line 
theory (references 73 to 76). Application of such methods 
to wings of conventional plan form without spanwise discon­
tinuities yields results of reasonable engineering accuracy 
(reference 77), especially with regard to such important 
characteristics as the angle of zero lift, the lift-curve slope, 
the pitching moment, and the drag. Basically similar 
methods not requiring the assumption of linear section lift 
. characteristics (references 78 and 79) appear capable of 
yielding results of greater accuracy, especially at high lift 
coefficients. Further refinement may be made by consider­
ation of the chordwise distribution of lift (reference 80). 
Wings with large amounts of sweep require special consider­
ation (reference 81). The usual wing theory assumes that the resultant air force 
and moment on any wing section are functions of only the 
section lift coefficient (or angle of attack) and the section 
shape. According to this assumption, the air forces and 
moments on any section are not affected by adjacent sections 
or other features of the wing except as such sections or 
features affect the lift distribution and thus the local lift of 
the section under consideration. These assumptions ob­
viously are not valid near wing tips, near discontinuities in 
deflected flaps or ailerons, near disturbing bodies, or for 
wings with pronounced sweep or sudden changes in plan 
form, section, or twist. Under such circumstances, cross flows 
result in a breakdown of the concept of two-dimensional 
flow over the airfoil sections. In addition to th('se 
cross flows, induced effects exist that are equivalent to a 
change in camber. Such effects are particularly marked 
near the wing tips for wings of normal plan form and for 
wings of low aspect ratio or unusual plan form. Lifting­
surface theory (see, for example, reference 81) provides a 
means for· calculating wing characteristics more accurately 
than the simple lifting-line theory. 
Although span load distributions calculated for wings with 
discontinuities such as are found with partial-span flaps 
(references 82 and 83) may be sufficiently accurate for 
structural design, such distributions are not suitable for 
predicting maximum-lift and stalling characteristics. Until 
sufficient data are obtained to permit the prediction of the 
maximum-lift and stalling characteristics of wings with 
discontinuities, these characteristics may best be estimated 
from previous results with similar wings or, in the case of 
unusual configurations, should be obtained by test. 
The characteristics of intermediate wing sections must be 
known for the application of wing theory, but data for such 
sections are seldom available. Tests of a number of such 
intermediate sections obtained by several manufacturers for 
wings formed by straight-line fairing have indicated that the 
characteristics of such sections may be obtained with reason­
able accuracy by interpolation of the root and tip character­
istics according to the thickness variation. 
SELECTION- OF ROOT SECTION 
The characteristics of a wing are affected to a large extent 
by the root section. In the case of tapered wings formed by 
straight-line fairing, the resulting nonlinear variation of sec­
tion along the span causes the shapes of the sections to be 
predominantly affected by the root section over a large part 
of the wing area. The desirability of having a thick wing 
that provides space for housing fuel and equipment and re­
duces structural weight or permits large spans usually leads 
to the selection of the thickest root section that is aerody­
namically feasible. The comparatively small variation of 
minimum drag coefficient with thickness ratio for smooth 
airfoils in the normal range of thickness ratios and the main­
tenance of high lift coefficient for thick sections with flaps 
deflected usually result in limitation of thickness ratio by 
characteristics other than maximum lift and minimum drag. 52 HEPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS 
The critical Mach number of the section is the most serious 
limitation of thickness ratio for high-speed airplanes. It is 
desirable to select a root section with a critical Mach number 
sufficiently high to avoid serious drag increases resulting from 
compressibility effects at the highest level-flight speed of the 
airplane, allowance being made for the increased velocity of 
flow over the wing resulting from interference of bodies and 
slipstream. Available data indicate that a small margin 
exists between the critical Mach number and the Mach num­
ber at which the drag increases sharply. As airplane speeds 
increase, it becomes increasingly difficult and finally impos­
sible to avoid the drag increases resulting from compressibil­
ity effects by reduction of the airfoil thickness ratio. 
In the cases of airplanes of such low speeds that compressi­
bility considerations do not limit the thickness ratio to values 
less than about 0.20, the maximum thickness ratio is limited 
by excessive drag coefficients at moderate and high lift 
coefficients with the surfaces rough. In these cases, tho 
actual surface conditions expected for the airplane should be 
considered in selecting the section. Consideration should 
also be given to unusual conditions such as ice, mud, and 
damage caused in military combat, especially in the case of 
multiengine airplanes for which ability to fly under such 
conditions is desired with one or more engines inoperative. 
In cases for which root sections having large thickness ratios 
are under consideration to permit the use of high aspect ratios, 
a realistic appraisal of the drag coefficients of such sections 
with the expected surface conditions at moderately high lift 
coefficients will indicate an optimum aspect ratio beyond 
which corresponding increases in aspect ratio and root thick­
ness ratio will result in reduced performance. 
Inboard sections of wings on conventional airplanes are 
subject to interference effects and may be in the propeller 
slipstream. The wing surfaces are likely to be roughened by 
access doors, landing-gear retraction wells, and armament 
installations. Attainment of extensive laminar flows is, 
therefore, less likely on the inboard wing panels than on the 
outboard panels. Unless such effects are minimized, little 
drag reduction is to be expected from the use of sections 
permitting extensive laminar flow. Under these conditions, 
the use of sections such as the N ACA 63-series will provide 
advantages if the sections are thick, because such sections are 
more conservative than those permitting more extensive 
laminar flow. 
SELECTION OF TIP SECTION 
In order to promote desirable stalling characteristics, the 
tip section should have a high maximum lift coefficient and 
a large range of angle of attack between zero and maxi­
Inurn lift as compared with the root section. It is also 
desirable that the tip section stall without a large sudden loss 
in lift. The attainment of a high maximum lift coefficient is 
often more difficult at the tip section than at the root section 
tor tapered wings because of the lower Reynolds number of 
fhe tip section. For wings with small camber, the most 
effective way of increasing the section maximum lift coeffi­
cient is to increase the camber. The amount of camber used 
will be limited in most cases by either the critical-speed 
requirements or by the requirement that the section have 
low drag at the high-speed lift coefficient. The selection of the optimum type of camber for the tip 
section presents problems for which no categorical answers 
can be given on the basis of existing data. The use of a type 
of camber that imposes heavy loads on the ailerons compli­
cates the design of the lateral-control system and increases 
its weight. The use of a type of camber that carries the lift 
farther forward on the section and thus relieyes the ailerons 
will, however, have little effect on the maximum lift coeffi­
cient of the section unless the maximum-camber position is 
well forward, as for the N ACA 230-series sections. In this 
case a sudden loss of lift at the stall may be expected. The 
effects on the camber of modifications to the airfoil contour 
near the trailing edge, which may be made in designing the 
ailerons, should not be overlooked in estimating the charac­
teristics of the wing. 
If the root sections are at least moderately thick, it is 
usually desirable to select a tip section with a somewhat 
reduced thickness ratio. This reduction in thickness ratio, 
together with the absence of induced velocities from inter­
fering bodies, gives a margin in critical speed that permits the 
camber of the tip section to be increased. This reduction in 
thickness ratio will probably be limited by the loss in maxi­
milm lift coefficient resulting from too thin a section. 
A small amount of aerodynamic washout may also be 
useful as an aid in the avoidance of tip stalling. The per­
missible amount of washout may not be limited by the in­
crease in induced drag, which is small for 10 or 2° of washout 
(reference 73). The limiting washout may be that which 
causes the tip section to operate outside the low-drag range 
at the high-speed lift coefficient. This limitation may be 
so severe as to require some adjustment of the camber to 
permit the use of any washout. 
A change in airfoil section between the root and tip may 
be desirable to obtain favorable stalling characteristics or 
to take advantage of the greater extent of laminar flow that 
may be possible on the outboal"d sections. Thus, such com­
binations as an NACA 230-series root section with an NACA 
44-series tip section or an N ACA 63-series root section with 
an N ACA 65-series tip section may be desirable. 
It should be noted that the tip sections may easily be so 
heavily loaded by the use of an unfavorable plan form as to 
cause tip stalling with any reasonable choice of section and 
washout. Both high taper ratios and large amounts of 
sweepback are unfavorable in this respect and are particu­
larly bad when used together, because the resulting tip stall 
promotes longitudinal instability at the stall in addition to 
the usual lateral instability. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the data 
presented. :a.:fost of the data, particularly for the lift, drag, 
and pitching-moment characteristics, were obtained at 
Reynolds numbers from 3 to 9XI06• 
1. Airfoil sections permitting extensive laminar flow, such 
as the NACA 6-and 7-series sections, result in substantial 
reductions in drag at high-speed and cruising lift coefficients 
. as compared with other sections if, and only if, the wing 
surfaces are fair and smooth. SUMMARY OF AIRFOIL DATA 53 
2. Experience with full-size wings has shown that extensive 
lnminnr flows nre obtainable if the surface finish is as smooth 
ns thnt provided by sanding in the chordwise direction with 
No. 320 curborundmn paper and if the surface is free from 
smull scattered defects and specks. Satisfactory results 
are usually obtained if the surface is sufficiently fair to permit 
n straightedge to be rocked smoothly in the chordwise direc­
tion without jarring or clicking. 
3. For ,vings of moderate thickness ratios with surface 
conditions corresponding to those obtained with current 
construction methods, minimum drag coefficients of the 
order of 0.0080 may be expected. The values of the mini­
mum drag coefficient for such wings depend primarily on 
the surface condition rather than on the airfoil section. 
4. Substantial reductions in drag coefficient at high 
Reynolds numbers may be obtained by smoothing the 
wing surfaces, even if extensive laminar flow is not obtained. 
5. The maximum lift coefficients for moderately cambered 
smooth NACA 6-series airfoils with the uniform-load type 
of mean line are as high as those for NACA 24-and 44-series 
airfoils. The NACA 230-series airfoils have somewhat 
higher maximum lift coefficients for thickness ratios less 
than 0.20. 
6. The maximum lift coefficients of airfoils with flaps are 
about the same for moderately thick NACA 6-seriessections 
as for the NACA 23012 section but appear to be considerably 
lower for thinner N ACA 6-series sections. 
7. The lift-curve slopes for smooth N ACA 6-series airfoils 
are slightly higher than for N ACA 24-, 44-, and 230-series 
airfoils and usually exceed the theoretical value for thin 
airfoils. 
8. Leading-edge roughness causes large reductions in 
maximum lift coefficient for both plain airfoils and airfoils 
equipped with split flaps deflected 60°. The decrement in 
maximum lift coefficient resulting from standard roughness 
is essentially the same for the plain airfoils as for the airfoils 
equipped with the 60° split flaps. 9. The effect of leading-edge roughness is to decrease the 
lift-curve slope, particularly for the thicker sections having 
the position of minimum pressure far back. 
10. Characteristics of airfoil sections with the expected 
surface conditions must be known or estimated to provide a 
satisfactory basis for the prediction of the characteristics of 
practical-construction wings and the selection of airfoils 
for such wings. 
11. The N A CA 6 series airfoils provide higher critical 
Mach numbers for high-speed and cruising lift coefficients 
than earlier types of sections and have a. reasonable range 
of lift coefficients within which high critical Mach numbers 
may be obtained. 
12. The NACA 6-series sections provide lower predicted 
critical ::\-fach numbers at moderately high lift coefficients 
than the earlier types of sections. The limited data avail­
able suggest, however, that the NACA 6-series sections retain 
satisfactory lift characteristics up to higher Mach numbers 
than the earlier sections. 
13. The NACA 6-series airfoils do not appear to present 
unusual problems with regard to the application of ailerons. 
14. Problems associated with the avoidance of boundary­
layer separation caused by interference are expected to be 
similar for conservative NACA 6-series sections and other 
good airfoils. Detail shapes for optimum interfering bodies 
and fillets may be different for various sections if local exces­
sive expansions in the flow are to be avoided. 
15. Satisfactory leading-edge air intakes may be provided 
for NACA 6-series sections, but insufficient information exists 
to allow such intakes to be designed without experimental 
development.

METHODS OF OBTAINING DATA IN THE LANGLEY TWO·DIMENSIONAL LOW.TURBULENCE TUNNELS 
By MILTON M. KLEIN 
DESCRIPTION OF TUNNELS 
The Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnels are 
closed-throat wind tunnels having rectangular test sections 
3 feet wide and 7% feet high and are designed to test models 
completely spanning the width of the tunnel in two­
dimensional flow. The low-turbulence level of these tunnels, 
amounting to only a few hundredths of 1 percent, is achieved 
by the large contraction ratio in the entrance cone (approx. 
20: 1) and by the introduction of a number of fine­
wire small-mesh turbulence-reducing screens in the widest 
part of the entrance cone. The chord of models tested in 
these tunnels is usually about 2 feet, although the characteris­
tics at low lift coefficients of models having chords as large 
as 8 feet may be determined. 
The Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnel oper­
ates at atmospheric pressure and has a maximum speed of 
approximately 155 miles per hour. The Langley two­
dimensional low-turbulence pressure tunnel operates at pres­
sures up to 10 atmospheres absolute and has a maximum 
speed of approximately 300 miles per hour at atmospheric 
pressure. Standard airfoil tests in this tunnel a,re made of 
2-foot-chord wooden models up to Reynolds numbers of 
approximately 9X 106 at a pressure of 4 atmospheres absolute. 
The lift and drag characteristics of airfoils tested in these 
tunnels are usually measured by methods other than the use 
of balances. The lift is evaluated from measurements of the 
pressure reactions on the floor and ceiling of the tunnel. The 
drag is obtained from measurements of static and t9tal 
pressures in the wake. Moments titre usually measured by a 
balance.

MEASUREMENT OF LIFT 
The lift carried by the airfoil induces an equal and opposite 
reaction upon the floor and ceiling of the tunnel. The lift 
may therefore be obtained by integrating the pressure dis­
tribution along the floor and ceiling of the tunnel, the inte­
gration being accomplished with an integrating manometer. 
Because the pressure field theoretically extends to infinity in 
both the upstream and the downstream directions, not all the 
lift is included in the length over which the integration is 
performed. It is therefore necessary to apply a correction 
factor'T] that gives the ratio of the measured lift to the actual 
lift for any lift distribution. The calculation was performed 
by first finding the correction factor 'lJx applying to a point 
vortex and then determining the weighted average of this 
factor over the chord of the model. The factor 'T]x was obtained as follows: The image system 
which gives only a tangential component of velocity along the 
tunnel walls is made up of an infinite vertical row of vortices 
of alternating sign as shown in figure 64. If the sign of the 
vortex at the origin is assumed to be positive, the complex 
potential functionj for this image system is .

In the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnels,

measure the lift extend over a length of approximately 13

table for a model having a chord length of 2 feet, where 'YJb is

In order to check the variation of 'YJa with variations in the 
additional type of lift distribution, the value of 'YJa was re­
calculated for the class C additional lift distribution given in 
figure 6 of reference 74. The value of 'YJa for this case was 
0.9304, as compared with 0.9296 for a thin airfoil. Because 
of the small variation of 'YJa with the type of additional lift, 
the value for thin-airfoil additional lift was used for all cal­
culations. The lift coefficient of the model in the tunnel 
uncorrected for blocking c/ is given in terms of the lift co­
efficient measured in the tunnel CIT and the design lift coeffi­
cient of the airfoil Cit by the following expression: 
(24) 
Because 'YJb does not differ much from 'YJa, it is not necessary 
that the basic loading or the design lift coefficient be known 
with great accuracy. 
Because of tunnel-wall and other effects, the lift distribu­
tion over the airfoil in the turinel does not agree exactly with 
the assumed lift distribution. Because of the small varia­
tions of 'YJ with lift distribution, errors caused by this effect are 
considered negligible. It can also be shown that. errors caused 
by neglecting the effect of airfoil thickness on the distri­
bution of the lift reaction along the tunnel walls are small. 
MEASUREMENT OF DRAG 
The drag of an airfoil may be obtained from observations 
of the pressures in the wake (reference 84). An approxi­
mation to the drag is given by the loss in total pressure of the 
air in the wake of the airfoil. The loss of total pressure is 
measured by a rake of total-pressure tubes in the wake. 
When the total pressures in front of the airfoil and in the 
wake are represented by Ho and HI, respectively, the drag 
coefficient obtained from loss of total pressure CdT is 
Cd = r Hcdyw

In order to obtain this expression, consider the flow past a

function for this flow is given by equation (28). Differen­
tiating and multiplying equation (28) by z gives

where the integration is taken from the leading edge to the 
trailing edge over the upper surface. 
In addition to the error caused by blocking, an error .}xists 
in the measured tunnel velocity'because of the interference 
effects of the model upon the velocity indicated by the static­
pressure orifices located a few feet upstream of the model 
and halfway between floor and ceiling. In order to correct 
for this error, an analysis was made of the velocity distribu­
tion along the streamline halfway between the upper and the 
lower tunnel walls for Rankine ovals of various sizes and thick­
ness ratios. The analysis showed'that the correction could 
be expressed, within the range of conventional-airfoil 
thickness ratios, as a product of a thickness factor given 
by the blocking factor A and a factor ~ which depended upon 
the size of the model and the distance from the static-pressure 
orifices to the midchord point of the model. The corrected 
indicated tunnel velocity V' could then be written 
V'= V"(1+A~) (36) 
where V" is the velocity measured by the static-pressure 
orifices. In the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence 
tunnels, the distance from the static-pressure orifices to the 
midchord point of the model is approximately 5.5 feet; the 
corresponding value of ~ for a 2-foot-chord model is approxi­
mately 0.002. 
In order to calculate the effect of the tunnel walls upon the 
lift distribution, a comparison is made of the lift distribution 
of a given airfoil in a tunnel and in free air on the basis of 
thin-airfoil theory. It is assumed that the flow conditions 
in the tunnel correspond most closely to those in free air when 
the additional lift in the tunnel and in free air are the same 
(reference 87). On this basis the following corrections are 
derived (reference 87), in which the primed quantities refer 
to the coefficients measured in the tunnel:

I h f·, 4 UCm 14' n t e oregolllg equatlons, the terms d 'Ide " UCXI ,and uc/14 ,CI CXo 0 
are usually negligible for 2-foot-chord models in the Langley 
two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnels. 
When the effect of the tunnel walls on the pressure distri­
bution over the model is small, the wall effect on the drag is 
merely that corresponding to an increase in the tunnel E!peed. 
The correction to the drag coefficient is therefore given by the 
following relation: ' 
ca=[1-2A(u+m ca' (40) 
Similar considerations have been applied to the development 
of corrections for the pressure distribution in reference 87. 
Equation (40) neglects the blocking due to the wake, such 
blocking being small at low to moderate drags. The effect 
of a pressure gradient in the tunnel upon loss of total pressure 
in the wake is not easily analyzed but is estimated to be small. 
The effect of the pressure gradient upon the drag has there­
fore been disregarded. When the drag is measured by a 
balance, the effect of the pressure gradient upon the drag is 
directly additive and a correction should be applied. For 
large models, especially at high lift coefficients, the effect of 
the tunnel walls is to distort the pressure distribution appre­
ciably. Such distortions of the pressure distribution may 
cause large changes in the boundary flow and no adequate 
corrections to any of the coefficients, 'particularly the drag, 
can be found. 
CORRECTION FOR BLOCKING AT mGH LIFTS 
SO long as the flow follows the airfoil surface, the foregoing 
relations account for the effects of the tunnel walls with suffi­
cient accuracy. When the flow leaves the surface, the block­
ing increases because of the predominant effect of the wake 
upon the free-stream velocity. Since the wake effect shows 
up primarily in the drag, the increase in blockilig would 
logically be expressed in terms of the drag. The accurate 
measurement of drag under these conditions by means of a 
rake is impractical because of spanwise movements of loW-­
energy air. A method of correcting for increased blocking 
at high angles of attack without drag measurements has 
therefore been devised for use in the Langley two-dimensional 
low-turbulence tunnels. ' 
Readings of the floor and ceiling velocities are taken a few 
inches ahead of the quarter-chord point and averaged to 
remove the effect of lift. This average F, which is a measure 
of the effective tunnel velocity, is essentially constant in the 
low-lift range. The quantity FIFo, where Fo is the average 
value of F in the low-lift range, however, shows a variation from unity in the high-lift range for ap.y airfoil tested in the 
tunnel; this variation indicates a change in blocking at high 
lifts. A plot of FIFo against angle of attack cxo' for a 2-foot­
chord model of the NACA 643-418 airfoil is given in figure 68. 
The quantity FIFo is nearly constant for values of cxo' up to 
12°; but for values of Il'o' greater than 12°, FIFo increases and 
the increase is partIcularly noticeable at and over the stall.

A theoretical comparison was made of the blocking factor 
Au and the velocity measured by the floor and ceiling orifices 
for a series of Rankine ovals of various sizes and thickness 
ratios. The quarter-chord point of each oval was located at 
the pivot point, the usual position of an airfoil in the tunnel. 
The analysis showed the relation between the blocking factor 
Au and the change in F to be unique for chord ler gths up 
to 50 inches in that different bodies having the same blocking 
factor Au gave approximately the same value of F. For 
chords up to 50 inches, the relationship is 
A: =0.45 (~ -1) (41) 
where A VIV is the true increment in tunnel velocity due to 
blocking; The foregoing relation :was adopted to obtain the 
correction to the blocking in the range of lifts where ~o > 1. 
Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the correct 
numel1ical value of the coefficient occurring in equation (41). 
If a row of sources, rather than the Rankine ovals used in 
the present analysis, is considered to represent the effect of 
the wake, the value of the coefficient in equation (41) would 
be approximately twice the value used. Fortunately, the 
correction amounts to only about 2 percent at maximum lift 
for an extreme condition with a 2-foot-chord model. Further 
refinement of this correction has therefore not been attempted. 
COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT 
A check of the validity of the tunnel-wall corrections has 
been made in reference 87, which gives lift and moment 
curves for models having various ratios of chord to tunnel 
height, uncorrected and corrected for tunnel-:-wall effects. 60 REPORT NO. 824-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS

The general agreement of the corrected curves shows that 
the method of correcting the lifts and moments is valid. 
A comparison is made in reference 87 between the theoreti­
cal correction factor (equation (40)) and the experimentally 
derived corrections of reference 88. The theoretical cor­
rection factors were found to be in good agreement with those 
obtained experimentally. 
In order to check the validity of the 'I-factor, a comparison 
has been made of lift values obtained from pressure dis:.. 
tributions with those obtained from the integration of the 
floor and ceiling pressures in the tunnel. A comparison for 
two airfoils given in figure 69 shows that the two methods of 
measuring lift give results that are in good agreement. The 
'I-factor has also been checked by comparison of the lift 
obtained _ from balance measurements with the integrating­
manometer values in figure 70. 
Finally, a check has been made of the method of correcting 
pressure distributions (reference 87) for NACA 6-series air­
foils of two chord lengths at zero angle of attack in figure 71, 
in which the pressure coefficients are plotted against chord­
wise position x/c. The agreement between the corrected 
pressure distributions for both models verifies the method of 
making the tunnel-wall corrections.
